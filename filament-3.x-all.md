title: Installation
---

**The Actions package is pre-installed with the [Panel Builder](/docs/panels).** This guide is for using the Actions package in a custom TALL Stack application (Tailwind, Alpine, Livewire, Laravel).

## Requirements

Filament requires the following to run:

- PHP 8.1+
- Laravel v10.0+
- Livewire v3.0+
- Tailwind v3.0+ [(Using Tailwind v4?)](#installing-tailwind-css)

## Installation

Require the Actions package using Composer:

```bash
composer require filament/actions:"^3.3" -W
```

## New Laravel projects

To quickly get started with Filament in a new Laravel project, run the following commands to install [Livewire](https://livewire.laravel.com), [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com):

> Since these commands will overwrite existing files in your application, only run this in a new Laravel project!

```bash
php artisan filament:install --scaffold --actions

npm install

npm run dev
```

## Existing Laravel projects

Run the following command to install the Actions package assets:

```bash
php artisan filament:install --actions
```

### Installing Tailwind CSS

> Filament uses Tailwind CSS v3 for styling. If your project uses Tailwind CSS v4, you will unfortunately need to downgrade it to v3 to use Filament. Filament v3 can't support Tailwind CSS v4 since it introduces breaking changes. Filament v4 will support Tailwind CSS v4.

Run the following command to install Tailwind CSS with the Tailwind Forms and Typography plugins:

```bash
npm install tailwindcss@3 @tailwindcss/forms @tailwindcss/typography postcss postcss-nesting autoprefixer --save-dev
```

Create a new `tailwind.config.js` file and add the Filament `preset` *(includes the Filament color scheme and the required Tailwind plugins)*:

```js
import preset from './vendor/filament/support/tailwind.config.preset'

export default {
    presets: [preset],
    content: [
        './app/Filament/**/*.php',
        './resources/views/filament/**/*.blade.php',
        './vendor/filament/**/*.blade.php',
    ],
}
```

### Configuring styles

Add Tailwind's CSS layers to your `resources/css/app.css`:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
@tailwind variants;
```

Create a `postcss.config.js` file in the root of your project and register Tailwind CSS, PostCSS Nesting and Autoprefixer as plugins:

```js
export default {
    plugins: {
        'tailwindcss/nesting': 'postcss-nesting',
        tailwindcss: {},
        autoprefixer: {},
    },
}
```

### Automatically refreshing the browser
You may also want to update your `vite.config.js` file to refresh the page automatically when Livewire components are updated:

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import laravel, { refreshPaths } from 'laravel-vite-plugin'

export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [
        laravel({
            input: ['resources/css/app.css', 'resources/js/app.js'],
            refresh: [
                ...refreshPaths,
                'app/Livewire/**',
            ],
        }),
    ],
})
```

### Compiling assets

Compile your new CSS and Javascript assets using `npm run dev`.

### Configuring your layout

Create a new `resources/views/components/layouts/app.blade.php` layout file for Livewire components:

```blade
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="{{ str_replace('_', '-', app()->getLocale()) }}">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">

        <meta name="application-name" content="{{ config('app.name') }}">
        <meta name="csrf-token" content="{{ csrf_token() }}">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

        <title>{{ config('app.name') }}</title>

        <style>
            [x-cloak] {
                display: none !important;
            }
        </style>

        @filamentStyles
        @vite('resources/css/app.css')
    </head>

    <body class="antialiased">
        {{ $slot }}

        @filamentScripts
        @vite('resources/js/app.js')
    </body>
</html>
```

## Publishing configuration

You can publish the package configuration using the following command (optional):

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=filament-config
```

## Upgrading

Filament automatically upgrades to the latest non-breaking version when you run `composer update`. After any updates, all Laravel caches need to be cleared, and frontend assets need to be republished. You can do this all at once using the `filament:upgrade` command, which should have been added to your `composer.json` file when you ran `filament:install` the first time:

```json
"post-autoload-dump": [
    // ...
    "@php artisan filament:upgrade"
],
```

Please note that `filament:upgrade` does not actually handle the update process, as Composer does that already. If you're upgrading manually without a `post-autoload-dump` hook, you can run the command yourself:

```bash
composer update

php artisan filament:upgrade
```

title: Overview

## What is an action?

"Action" is a word that is used quite a bit within the Laravel community. Traditionally, action PHP classes handle "doing" something in your application's business logic. For instance, logging a user in, sending an email, or creating a new user record in the database.

In Filament, actions also handle "doing" something in your app. However, they are a bit different from traditional actions. They are designed to be used in the context of a user interface. For instance, you might have a button to delete a client record, which opens a modal to confirm your decision. When the user clicks the "Delete" button in the modal, the client is deleted. This whole workflow is an "action".

```php
Action::make('delete')
    ->requiresConfirmation()
    ->action(fn () => $this->client->delete())
```

Actions can also collect extra information from the user. For instance, you might have a button to email a client. When the user clicks the button, a modal opens to collect the email subject and body. When the user clicks the "Send" button in the modal, the email is sent:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\RichEditor;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Mail;

Action::make('sendEmail')
    ->form([
        TextInput::make('subject')->required(),
        RichEditor::make('body')->required(),
    ])
    ->action(function (array $data) {
        Mail::to($this->client)
            ->send(new GenericEmail(
                subject: $data['subject'],
                body: $data['body'],
            ));
    })
```

Usually, actions get executed without redirecting the user away from the page. This is because we extensively use Livewire. However, actions can be much simpler, and don't even need a modal. You can pass a URL to an action, and when the user clicks on the button, they are redirected to that page:

```php
Action::make('edit')
    ->url(fn (): string => route('posts.edit', ['post' => $this->post]))
```

The entire look of the action's trigger button and the modal is customizable using fluent PHP methods. We provide a sensible and consistent styling for the UI, but all of this is customizable with CSS.

## Types of action

The concept of "actions" is used throughout Filament in many contexts. Some contexts don't support opening modals from actions - they can only open a URL, call a public Livewire method, or dispatch a Livewire event. Additionally, different contexts use different action PHP classes since they provide the developer context-aware data that is appropriate to that use-case.

### Custom Livewire component actions

You can add an action to any Livewire component in your app, or even a page in a [panel](../panels/pages).

These actions use the `Filament\Actions\Action` class. They can open a modal if you choose, or even just a URL.

If you're looking to add an action to a Livewire component, [visit this page](adding-an-action-to-a-livewire-component) in the docs. If you want to add an action to the header of a page in a panel, [visit this page](../panels/pages#header-actions) instead.

### Table actions

Filament's tables also use actions. Actions can be added to the end of any table row, or even in the header of a table. For instance, you may want an action to "create" a new record in the header, and then "edit" and "delete" actions on each row. Additionally, actions can be added to any table column, such that each cell in that column is a trigger for your action.

These actions use the `Filament\Tables\Actions\Action` class. They can open a modal if you choose, or even just a URL.

If you're looking to add an action to a table in your app, [visit this page](../tables/actions) in the docs.

#### Table bulk actions

Tables also support "bulk actions". These can be used when the user selects rows in the table. Traditionally, when rows are selected, a "bulk actions" button appears in the top left corner of the table. When the user clicks this button, they are presented with a dropdown menu of actions to choose from. Bulk actions may also be added to the header of a table, next to other header actions. In this case, bulk action trigger buttons are disabled until the user selects table rows.

These actions use the `Filament\Tables\Actions\BulkAction` class. They can open modals if you choose.

If you're looking to add a bulk action to a table in your app, [visit this page](../tables/actions#bulk-actions) in the docs.

### Form component actions

Form components can contain actions. A good use case for actions inside form components would be with a select field, and an action button to "create" a new record. When you click on the button, a modal opens to collect the new record's data. When the modal form is submitted, the new record is created in the database, and the select field is filled with the newly created record. Fortunately, [this case is handled for you out of the box](../forms/fields/select#creating-new-records), but it's a good example of how form component actions can be powerful.

These actions use the `Filament\Forms\Components\Actions\Action` class. They can open a modal if you choose, or even just a URL.

If you're looking to add an action to a form component in your app, [visit this page](../forms/actions) in the docs.

### Infolist component actions

Infolist components can contain actions. These use the `Filament\Infolists\Components\Actions\Action` class. They can open a modal if you choose, or even just a URL.

If you're looking to add an action to an infolist component in your app, [visit this page](../infolists/actions) in the docs.

### Notification actions

When you [send notifications](../notifications/sending-notifications), you can add actions. These buttons are rendered below the content of the notification. For example, a notification to alert the user that they have a new message should contain an action button that opens the conversation thread.

These actions use the `Filament\Notifications\Actions\Action` class. They aren't able to open modals, but they can open a URL or dispatch a Livewire event.

If you're looking to add an action to a notification in your app, [visit this page](../notifications/sending-notifications#adding-actions-to-notifications) in the docs.

### Global search result actions

In the Panel Builder, there is a [global search](../panels/resources/global-search) field that allows you to search all resources in your app from one place. When you click on a search result, it leads you to the resource page for that record. However, you may add additional actions below each global search result. For example, you may want both "Edit" and "View" options for a client search result, so the user can quickly edit their profile as well as view it in read-only mode.

These actions use the `Filament\GlobalSearch\Actions\Action` class. They aren't able to open modals, but they can open a URL or dispatch a Livewire event.

If you're looking to add an action to a global search result in a panel, [visit this page](../panels/resources/global-search#adding-actions-to-global-search-results) in the docs.

## Prebuilt actions

Filament includes several prebuilt actions that you can add to your app. Their aim is to simplify the most common Eloquent-related actions:

- [Create](prebuilt-actions/create)
- [Edit](prebuilt-actions/edit)
- [View](prebuilt-actions/view)
- [Delete](prebuilt-actions/delete)
- [Replicate](prebuilt-actions/replicate)
- [Force-delete](prebuilt-actions/force-delete)
- [Restore](prebuilt-actions/restore)
- [Import](prebuilt-actions/import)
- [Export](prebuilt-actions/export)

## Grouping actions

You may group actions together into a dropdown menu by using an `ActionGroup` object. Groups may contain many actions, or other groups:

```php
ActionGroup::make([
    Action::make('view'),
    Action::make('edit'),
    Action::make('delete'),
])
```

To learn about how to group actions, see the [Grouping actions](grouping-actions) page.

# Documentation for actions. File: 03-trigger-button.md
---
title: Trigger button
---
import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"

## Overview

All actions have a trigger button. When the user clicks on it, the action is executed - a modal will open, a closure function will be executed, or they will be redirected to a URL.

This page is about customizing the look of that trigger button.

## Choosing a trigger style

Out of the box, action triggers have 4 styles - "button", "link", "icon button", and "badge".

"Button" triggers have a background color, label, and optionally an [icon](#setting-an-icon). Usually, this is the default button style, but you can use it manually with the `button()` method:

```php
Action::make('edit')
    ->button()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="actions/trigger-button/button" alt="Button trigger" version="3.x" />

"Link" triggers have no background color. They must have a label and optionally an [icon](#setting-an-icon). They look like a link that you might find embedded within text. You can switch to that style with the `link()` method:

```php
Action::make('edit')
    ->link()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="actions/trigger-button/link" alt="Link trigger" version="3.x" />

"Icon button" triggers are circular buttons with an [icon](#setting-an-icon) and no label. You can switch to that style with the `iconButton()` method:

```php
Action::make('edit')
    ->icon('heroicon-m-pencil-square')
    ->iconButton()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="actions/trigger-button/icon-button" alt="Icon button trigger" version="3.x" />

"Badge" triggers have a background color, label, and optionally an [icon](#setting-an-icon). You can use a badge as trigger using the `badge()` method:

```php
Action::make('edit')
    ->badge()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="actions/trigger-button/badge" alt="Badge trigger" version="3.x" />

### Using an icon button on mobile devices only

You may want to use a button style with a label on desktop, but remove the label on mobile. This will transform it into an icon button. You can do this with the `labeledFrom()` method, passing in the responsive [breakpoint](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design#overview) at which you want the label to be added to the button:

```php
Action::make('edit')
    ->icon('heroicon-m-pencil-square')
    ->button()
    ->labeledFrom('md')
```

## Setting a label

By default, the label of the trigger button is generated from its name. You may customize this using the `label()` method:

```php
Action::make('edit')
    ->label('Edit post')
    ->url(fn (): string => route('posts.edit', ['post' => $this->post]))
```

Optionally, you can have the label automatically translated [using Laravel's localization features](https://laravel.com/docs/localization) with the `translateLabel()` method:

```php
Action::make('edit')
    ->translateLabel() // Equivalent to `label(__('Edit'))`
    ->url(fn (): string => route('posts.edit', ['post' => $this->post]))
```

## Setting a color

Buttons may have a color to indicate their significance. It may be either `danger`, `gray`, `info`, `primary`, `success` or `warning`:

```php
Action::make('delete')
    ->color('danger')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="actions/trigger-button/danger" alt="Red trigger" version="3.x" />

## Setting a size

Buttons come in 3 sizes - `ActionSize::Small`, `ActionSize::Medium` or `ActionSize::Large`. You can change the size of the action's trigger using the `size()` method:

```php
use Filament\Support\Enums\ActionSize;

Action::make('create')
    ->size(ActionSize::Large)
```

<AutoScreenshot name="actions/trigger-button/large" alt="Large trigger" version="3.x" />

## Setting an icon

Buttons may have an [icon](https://blade-ui-kit.com/blade-icons?set=1#search) to add more detail to the UI. You can set the icon using the `icon()` method:

```php
Action::make('edit')
    ->url(fn (): string => route('posts.edit', ['post' => $this->post]))
    ->icon('heroicon-m-pencil-square')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="actions/trigger-button/icon" alt="Trigger with icon" version="3.x" />

You can also change the icon's position to be after the label instead of before it, using the `iconPosition()` method:

```php
use Filament\Support\Enums\IconPosition;

Action::make('edit')
    ->url(fn (): string => route('posts.edit', ['post' => $this->post]))
    ->icon('heroicon-m-pencil-square')
    ->iconPosition(IconPosition::After)
```

<AutoScreenshot name="actions/trigger-button/icon-after" alt="Trigger with icon after the label" version="3.x" />

## Authorization

You may conditionally show or hide actions for certain users. To do this, you can use either the `visible()` or `hidden()` methods:

```php
Action::make('edit')
    ->url(fn (): string => route('posts.edit', ['post' => $this->post]))
    ->visible(auth()->user()->can('update', $this->post))

Action::make('edit')
    ->url(fn (): string => route('posts.edit', ['post' => $this->post]))
    ->hidden(! auth()->user()->can('update', $this->post))
```

This is useful for authorization of certain actions to only users who have permission.

### Disabling a button

If you want to disable a button instead of hiding it, you can use the `disabled()` method:

```php
Action::make('delete')
    ->disabled()
```

You can conditionally disable a button by passing a boolean to it:

```php
Action::make('delete')
    ->disabled(! auth()->user()->can('delete', $this->post))
```

## Registering keybindings

You can attach keyboard shortcuts to trigger buttons. These use the same key codes as [Mousetrap](https://craig.is/killing/mice):

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('save')
    ->action(fn () => $this->save())
    ->keyBindings(['command+s', 'ctrl+s'])
```

## Adding a badge to the corner of the button

You can add a badge to the corner of the button, to display whatever you want. It's useful for displaying a count of something, or a status indicator:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('filter')
    ->iconButton()
    ->icon('heroicon-m-funnel')
    ->badge(5)
```

<AutoScreenshot name="actions/trigger-button/badged" alt="Trigger with badge" version="3.x" />

You can also pass a color to be used for the badge, which can be either `danger`, `gray`, `info`, `primary`, `success` and `warning`:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('filter')
    ->iconButton()
    ->icon('heroicon-m-funnel')
    ->badge(5)
    ->badgeColor('success')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="actions/trigger-button/success-badged" alt="Trigger with green badge" version="3.x" />

## Outlined button style

When you're using the "button" trigger style, you might wish to make it less prominent. You could use a different [color](#setting-a-color), but sometimes you might want to make it outlined instead. You can do this with the `outlined()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('edit')
    ->url(fn (): string => route('posts.edit', ['post' => $this->post]))
    ->button()
    ->outlined()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="actions/trigger-button/outlined" alt="Outlined trigger button" version="3.x" />

## Adding extra HTML attributes

You can pass extra HTML attributes to the button which will be merged onto the outer DOM element. Pass an array of attributes to the `extraAttributes()` method, where the key is the attribute name and the value is the attribute value:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('edit')
    ->url(fn (): string => route('posts.edit', ['post' => $this->post]))
    ->extraAttributes([
        'title' => 'Edit this post',
    ])
```

If you pass CSS classes in a string, they will be merged with the default classes that already apply to the other HTML element of the button:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('edit')
    ->url(fn (): string => route('posts.edit', ['post' => $this->post]))
    ->extraAttributes([
        'class' => 'mx-auto my-8',
    ])
```

# Documentation for actions. File: 04-modals.md
---
title: Modals
---
import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"

## Overview

Actions may require additional confirmation or input from the user before they run. You may open a modal before an action is executed to do this.

## Confirmation modals

You may require confirmation before an action is run using the `requiresConfirmation()` method. This is useful for particularly destructive actions, such as those that delete records.

```php
use App\Models\Post;

Action::make('delete')
    ->action(fn (Post $record) => $record->delete())
    ->requiresConfirmation()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="actions/modal/confirmation" alt="Confirmation modal" version="3.x" />

> The confirmation modal is not available when a `url()` is set instead of an `action()`. Instead, you should redirect to the URL within the `action()` closure.

## Modal forms

You may also render a form in the modal to collect extra information from the user before the action runs.

You may use components from the [Form Builder](../forms) to create custom action modal forms. The data from the form is available in the `$data` array of the `action()` closure:

```php
use App\Models\Post;
use App\Models\User;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Action::make('updateAuthor')
    ->form([
        Select::make('authorId')
            ->label('Author')
            ->options(User::query()->pluck('name', 'id'))
            ->required(),
    ])
    ->action(function (array $data, Post $record): void {
        $record->author()->associate($data['authorId']);
        $record->save();
    })
```

<AutoScreenshot name="actions/modal/form" alt="Modal with form" version="3.x" />

### Filling the form with existing data

You may fill the form with existing data, using the `fillForm()` method:

```php
use App\Models\Post;
use App\Models\User;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;
use Filament\Forms\Form;

Action::make('updateAuthor')
    ->fillForm(fn (Post $record): array => [
        'authorId' => $record->author->id,
    ])
    ->form([
        Select::make('authorId')
            ->label('Author')
            ->options(User::query()->pluck('name', 'id'))
            ->required(),
    ])
    ->action(function (array $data, Post $record): void {
        $record->author()->associate($data['authorId']);
        $record->save();
    })
```

### Using a wizard as a modal form

You may create a [multistep form wizard](../forms/layout/wizard) inside a modal. Instead of using a `form()`, define a `steps()` array and pass your `Step` objects:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\MarkdownEditor;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Toggle;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Wizard\Step;

Action::make('create')
    ->steps([
        Step::make('Name')
            ->description('Give the category a unique name')
            ->schema([
                TextInput::make('name')
                    ->required()
                    ->live()
                    ->afterStateUpdated(fn ($state, callable $set) => $set('slug', Str::slug($state))),
                TextInput::make('slug')
                    ->disabled()
                    ->required()
                    ->unique(Category::class, 'slug'),
            ])
            ->columns(2),
        Step::make('Description')
            ->description('Add some extra details')
            ->schema([
                MarkdownEditor::make('description'),
            ]),
        Step::make('Visibility')
            ->description('Control who can view it')
            ->schema([
                Toggle::make('is_visible')
                    ->label('Visible to customers.')
                    ->default(true),
            ]),
    ])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="actions/modal/wizard" alt="Modal with wizard" version="3.x" />

### Disabling all form fields

You may wish to disable all form fields in the modal, ensuring the user cannot edit them. You may do so using the `disabledForm()` method:

```php
use App\Models\Post;
use App\Models\User;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Textarea;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

Action::make('approvePost')
    ->form([
        TextInput::make('title'),
        Textarea::make('content'),
    ])
    ->fillForm(fn (Post $record): array => [
        'title' => $record->title,
        'content' => $record->content,
    ])
    ->disabledForm()
    ->action(function (Post $record): void {
        $record->approve();
    })
```

## Customizing the modal's heading, description, and submit action label

You may customize the heading, description and label of the submit button in the modal:

```php
use App\Models\Post;

Action::make('delete')
    ->action(fn (Post $record) => $record->delete())
    ->requiresConfirmation()
    ->modalHeading('Delete post')
    ->modalDescription('Are you sure you\'d like to delete this post? This cannot be undone.')
    ->modalSubmitActionLabel('Yes, delete it')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="actions/modal/confirmation-custom-text" alt="Confirmation modal with custom text" version="3.x" />

## Adding an icon inside the modal

You may add an [icon](https://blade-ui-kit.com/blade-icons?set=1#search) inside the modal using the `modalIcon()` method:

```php
use App\Models\Post;

Action::make('delete')
    ->action(fn (Post $record) => $record->delete())
    ->requiresConfirmation()
    ->modalIcon('heroicon-o-trash')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="actions/modal/icon" alt="Confirmation modal with icon" version="3.x" />

By default, the icon will inherit the color of the action button. You may customize the color of the icon using the `modalIconColor()` method:

```php
use App\Models\Post;

Action::make('delete')
    ->action(fn (Post $record) => $record->delete())
    ->requiresConfirmation()
    ->color('danger')
    ->modalIcon('heroicon-o-trash')
    ->modalIconColor('warning')
```

## Customizing the alignment of modal content

By default, modal content will be aligned to the start, or centered if the modal is `xs` or `sm` in [width](#changing-the-modal-width). If you wish to change the alignment of content in a modal, you can use the `modalAlignment()` method and pass it `Alignment::Start` or `Alignment::Center`:

```php
use Filament\Support\Enums\Alignment;

Action::make('updateAuthor')
    ->form([
        // ...
    ])
    ->action(function (array $data): void {
        // ...
    })
    ->modalAlignment(Alignment::Center)
```

## Custom modal content

You may define custom content to be rendered inside your modal, which you can specify by passing a Blade view into the `modalContent()` method:

```php
use App\Models\Post;

Action::make('advance')
    ->action(fn (Post $record) => $record->advance())
    ->modalContent(view('filament.pages.actions.advance'))
```

### Passing data to the custom modal content

You can pass data to the view by returning it from a function. For example, if the `$record` of an action is set, you can pass that through to the view:

```php
use Illuminate\Contracts\View\View;

Action::make('advance')
    ->action(fn (Contract $record) => $record->advance())
    ->modalContent(fn (Contract $record): View => view(
        'filament.pages.actions.advance',
        ['record' => $record],
    ))
```

### Adding custom modal content below the form

By default, the custom content is displayed above the modal form if there is one, but you can add content below using `modalContentFooter()` if you wish:

```php
use App\Models\Post;

Action::make('advance')
    ->action(fn (Post $record) => $record->advance())
    ->modalContentFooter(view('filament.pages.actions.advance'))
```

### Adding an action to custom modal content

You can add an action button to your custom modal content, which is useful if you want to add a button that performs an action other than the main action. You can do this by registering an action with the `registerModalActions()` method, and then passing it to the view:

```php
use App\Models\Post;
use Illuminate\Contracts\View\View;

Action::make('advance')
    ->registerModalActions([
        Action::make('report')
            ->requiresConfirmation()
            ->action(fn (Post $record) => $record->report()),
    ])
    ->action(fn (Post $record) => $record->advance())
    ->modalContent(fn (Action $action): View => view(
        'filament.pages.actions.advance',
        ['action' => $action],
    ))
```

Now, in the view file, you can render the action button by calling `getModalAction()`:

```blade
<div>
    {{ $action->getModalAction('report') }}
</div>
```

## Using a slide-over instead of a modal

You can open a "slide-over" dialog instead of a modal by using the `slideOver()` method:

```php
Action::make('updateAuthor')
    ->form([
        // ...
    ])
    ->action(function (array $data): void {
        // ...
    })
    ->slideOver()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="actions/modal/slide-over" alt="Slide over with form" version="3.x" />

Instead of opening in the center of the screen, the modal content will now slide in from the right and consume the entire height of the browser.

## Making the modal header sticky

The header of a modal scrolls out of view with the modal content when it overflows the modal size. However, slide-overs have a sticky header that's always visible. You may control this behavior using `stickyModalHeader()`:

```php
Action::make('updateAuthor')
    ->form([
        // ...
    ])
    ->action(function (array $data): void {
        // ...
    })
    ->stickyModalHeader()
```

## Making the modal footer sticky

The footer of a modal is rendered inline after the content by default. Slide-overs, however, have a sticky footer that always shows when scrolling the content. You may enable this for a modal too using `stickyModalFooter()`:

```php
Action::make('updateAuthor')
    ->form([
        // ...
    ])
    ->action(function (array $data): void {
        // ...
    })
    ->stickyModalFooter()
```

## Changing the modal width

You can change the width of the modal by using the `modalWidth()` method. Options correspond to [Tailwind's max-width scale](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/max-width). The options are `ExtraSmall`, `Small`, `Medium`, `Large`, `ExtraLarge`, `TwoExtraLarge`, `ThreeExtraLarge`, `FourExtraLarge`, `FiveExtraLarge`, `SixExtraLarge`, `SevenExtraLarge`, and `Screen`:

```php
use Filament\Support\Enums\MaxWidth;

Action::make('updateAuthor')
    ->form([
        // ...
    ])
    ->action(function (array $data): void {
        // ...
    })
    ->modalWidth(MaxWidth::FiveExtraLarge)
```

## Executing code when the modal opens

You may execute code within a closure when the modal opens, by passing it to the `mountUsing()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Form;

Action::make('create')
    ->mountUsing(function (Form $form) {
        $form->fill();

        // ...
    })
```

> The `mountUsing()` method, by default, is used by Filament to initialize the [form](#modal-forms). If you override this method, you will need to call `$form->fill()` to ensure the form is initialized correctly. If you wish to populate the form with data, you can do so by passing an array to the `fill()` method, instead of [using `fillForm()` on the action itself](#filling-the-form-with-existing-data).

## Customizing the action buttons in the footer of the modal

By default, there are two actions in the footer of a modal. The first is a button to submit, which executes the `action()`. The second button closes the modal and cancels the action.

### Modifying a default modal footer action button

To modify the action instance that is used to render one of the default action buttons, you may pass a closure to the `modalSubmitAction()` and `modalCancelAction()` methods:

```php
use Filament\Actions\StaticAction;

Action::make('help')
    ->modalContent(view('actions.help'))
    ->modalCancelAction(fn (StaticAction $action) => $action->label('Close'))
```

The [methods available to customize trigger buttons](trigger-button) will work to modify the `$action` instance inside the closure.

### Removing a default modal footer action button

To remove a default action, you may pass `false` to either `modalSubmitAction()` or `modalCancelAction()`:

```php
Action::make('help')
    ->modalContent(view('actions.help'))
    ->modalSubmitAction(false)
```

### Adding an extra modal action button to the footer

You may pass an array of extra actions to be rendered, between the default actions, in the footer of the modal using the `extraModalFooterActions()` method:

```php
Action::make('create')
    ->form([
        // ...
    ])
    // ...
    ->extraModalFooterActions(fn (Action $action): array => [
        $action->makeModalSubmitAction('createAnother', arguments: ['another' => true]),
    ])
```

`$action->makeModalSubmitAction()` returns an action instance that can be customized using the [methods available to customize trigger buttons](trigger-button).

The second parameter of `makeModalSubmitAction()` allows you to pass an array of arguments that will be accessible inside the action's `action()` closure as `$arguments`. These could be useful as flags to indicate that the action should behave differently based on the user's decision:

```php
Action::make('create')
    ->form([
        // ...
    ])
    // ...
    ->extraModalFooterActions(fn (Action $action): array => [
        $action->makeModalSubmitAction('createAnother', arguments: ['another' => true]),
    ])
    ->action(function (array $data, array $arguments): void {
        // Create

        if ($arguments['another'] ?? false) {
            // Reset the form and don't close the modal
        }
    })
```

#### Opening another modal from an extra footer action

You can nest actions within each other, allowing you to open a new modal from an extra footer action:

```php
Action::make('edit')
    // ...
    ->extraModalFooterActions([
        Action::make('delete')
            ->requiresConfirmation()
            ->action(function () {
                // ...
            }),
    ])
```

Now, the edit modal will have a "Delete" button in the footer, which will open a confirmation modal when clicked. This action is completely independent of the `edit` action, and will not run the `edit` action when it is clicked.

In this example though, you probably want to cancel the `edit` action if the `delete` action is run. You can do this using the `cancelParentActions()` method:

```php
Action::make('delete')
    ->requiresConfirmation()
    ->action(function () {
        // ...
    })
    ->cancelParentActions()
```

If you have deep nesting with multiple parent actions, but you don't want to cancel all of them, you can pass the name of the parent action you want to cancel, including its children, to `cancelParentActions()`:

```php
Action::make('first')
    ->requiresConfirmation()
    ->action(function () {
        // ...
    })
    ->extraModalFooterActions([
        Action::make('second')
            ->requiresConfirmation()
            ->action(function () {
                // ...
            })
            ->extraModalFooterActions([
                Action::make('third')
                    ->requiresConfirmation()
                    ->action(function () {
                        // ...
                    })
                    ->extraModalFooterActions([
                        Action::make('fourth')
                            ->requiresConfirmation()
                            ->action(function () {
                                // ...
                            })
                            ->cancelParentActions('second'),
                    ]),
            ]),
    ])
```

In this example, if the `fourth` action is run, the `second` action is canceled, but so is the `third` action since it is a child of `second`. The `first` action is not canceled, however, since it is the parent of `second`. The `first` action's modal will remain open.

## Closing the modal by clicking away

By default, when you click away from a modal, it will close itself. If you wish to disable this behavior for a specific action, you can use the `closeModalByClickingAway(false)` method:

```php
Action::make('updateAuthor')
    ->form([
        // ...
    ])
    ->action(function (array $data): void {
        // ...
    })
    ->closeModalByClickingAway(false)
```

If you'd like to change the behavior for all modals in the application, you can do so by calling `Modal::closedByClickingAway()` inside a service provider or middleware:

```php
use Filament\Support\View\Components\Modal;

Modal::closedByClickingAway(false);
```

## Closing the modal by escaping

By default, when you press escape on a modal, it will close itself. If you wish to disable this behavior for a specific action, you can use the `closeModalByEscaping(false)` method:

```php
Action::make('updateAuthor')
    ->form([
        // ...
    ])
    ->action(function (array $data): void {
        // ...
    })
    ->closeModalByEscaping(false)
```

If you'd like to change the behavior for all modals in the application, you can do so by calling `Modal::closedByEscaping()` inside a service provider or middleware:

```php
use Filament\Support\View\Components\Modal;

Modal::closedByEscaping(false);
```

## Hiding the modal close button

By default, modals have a close button in the top right corner. If you wish to hide the close button, you can use the `modalCloseButton(false)` method:

```php
Action::make('updateAuthor')
    ->form([
        // ...
    ])
    ->action(function (array $data): void {
        // ...
    })
    ->modalCloseButton(false)
```

If you'd like to hide the close button for all modals in the application, you can do so by calling `Modal::closeButton(false)` inside a service provider or middleware:

```php
use Filament\Support\View\Components\Modal;

Modal::closeButton(false);
```

## Preventing the modal from autofocusing

By default, modals will autofocus on the first focusable element when opened. If you wish to disable this behavior, you can use the `modalAutofocus(false)` method:

```php
Action::make('updateAuthor')
    ->form([
        // ...
    ])
    ->action(function (array $data): void {
        // ...
    })
    ->modalAutofocus(false)
```

If you'd like to disable autofocus for all modals in the application, you can do so by calling `Modal::autofocus(false)` inside a service provider or middleware:

```php
use Filament\Support\View\Components\Modal;

Modal::autofocus(false);
```

## Optimizing modal configuration methods

When you use database queries or other heavy operations inside modal configuration methods like `modalHeading()`, they can be executed more than once. This is because Filament uses these methods to decide whether to render the modal or not, and also to render the modal's content.

To skip the check that Filament does to decide whether to render the modal, you can use the `modal()` method, which will inform Filament that the modal exists for this action and it does not need to check again:

```php
Action::make('updateAuthor')
    ->modal()
```

## Conditionally hiding the modal

You may have a need to conditionally show a modal for confirmation reasons while falling back to the default action. This can be achieved using `modalHidden()`:

```php
Action::make('create')
    ->action(function (array $data): void {
        // ...
    })
    ->modalHidden(fn (): bool => $this->role !== 'admin')
    ->modalContent(view('filament.pages.actions.create'))
```

## Adding extra attributes to the modal window

You may also pass extra HTML attributes to the modal window using `extraModalWindowAttributes()`:

```php
Action::make('updateAuthor')
    ->extraModalWindowAttributes(['class' => 'update-author-modal'])
```

# Documentation for actions. File: 05-grouping-actions.md

import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"

## Overview

You may group actions together into a dropdown menu by using an `ActionGroup` object. Groups may contain many actions, or other groups:

```php
ActionGroup::make([
    Action::make('view'),
    Action::make('edit'),
    Action::make('delete'),
])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="actions/group/simple" alt="Action group" version="3.x" />

This page is about customizing the look of the group's trigger button and dropdown.

## Customizing the group trigger style

The button which opens the dropdown may be customized in the same way as a normal action. [All the methods available for trigger buttons](trigger-button) may be used to customize the group trigger button:

```php
use Filament\Support\Enums\ActionSize;

ActionGroup::make([
    // Array of actions
])
    ->label('More actions')
    ->icon('heroicon-m-ellipsis-vertical')
    ->size(ActionSize::Small)
    ->color('primary')
    ->button()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="actions/group/customized" alt="Action group with custom trigger style" version="3.x" />

## Setting the placement of the dropdown

The dropdown may be positioned relative to the trigger button by using the `dropdownPlacement()` method:

```php
ActionGroup::make([
    // Array of actions
])
    ->dropdownPlacement('top-start')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="actions/group/placement" alt="Action group with top placement style" version="3.x" />

## Adding dividers between actions

You may add dividers between groups of actions by using nested `ActionGroup` objects:

```php
ActionGroup::make([
    ActionGroup::make([
        // Array of actions
    ])->dropdown(false),
    // Array of actions
])
```

The `dropdown(false)` method puts the actions inside the parent dropdown, instead of a new nested dropdown.

<AutoScreenshot name="actions/group/nested" alt="Action groups nested with dividers" version="3.x" />

## Setting the width of the dropdown

The dropdown may be set to a width by using the `dropdownWidth()` method. Options correspond to [Tailwind's max-width scale](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/max-width). The options are `ExtraSmall`, `Small`, `Medium`, `Large`, `ExtraLarge`, `TwoExtraLarge`, `ThreeExtraLarge`, `FourExtraLarge`, `FiveExtraLarge`, `SixExtraLarge` and `SevenExtraLarge`:

```php
use Filament\Support\Enums\MaxWidth;

ActionGroup::make([
    // Array of actions
])
    ->dropdownWidth(MaxWidth::ExtraSmall)
```

## Controlling the maximum height of the dropdown

The dropdown content can have a maximum height using the `maxHeight()` method, so that it scrolls. You can pass a [CSS length](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length):

```php
ActionGroup::make([
    // Array of actions
])
    ->maxHeight('400px')
```

## Controlling the dropdown offset

You may control the offset of the dropdown using the `dropdownOffset()` method, by default the offset is set to `8`.

```php
ActionGroup::make([
    // Array of actions
])
    ->dropdownOffset(16)
```

# Documentation for actions. File: 06-adding-an-action-to-a-livewire-component.md
---
title: Adding an action to a Livewire component
---

## Setting up the Livewire component

First, generate a new Livewire component:

```bash
php artisan make:livewire ManageProduct
```

Then, render your Livewire component on the page:

```blade
@livewire('manage-product')
```

Alternatively, you can use a full-page Livewire component:

```php
use App\Livewire\ManageProduct;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

Route::get('products/{product}/manage', ManageProduct::class);
```

You must use the `InteractsWithActions` and `InteractsWithForms` traits, and implement the `HasActions` and `HasForms` interfaces on your Livewire component class:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Concerns\InteractsWithActions;
use Filament\Actions\Contracts\HasActions;
use Filament\Forms\Concerns\InteractsWithForms;
use Filament\Forms\Contracts\HasForms;
use Livewire\Component;

class ManagePost extends Component implements HasForms, HasActions
{
    use InteractsWithActions;
    use InteractsWithForms;

    // ...
}
```

## Adding the action

Add a method that returns your action. The method must share the exact same name as the action, or the name followed by `Action`:

```php
use App\Models\Post;
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Actions\Concerns\InteractsWithActions;
use Filament\Actions\Contracts\HasActions;
use Filament\Forms\Concerns\InteractsWithForms;
use Filament\Forms\Contracts\HasForms;
use Livewire\Component;

class ManagePost extends Component implements HasForms, HasActions
{
    use InteractsWithActions;
    use InteractsWithForms;

    public Post $post;

    public function deleteAction(): Action
    {
        return Action::make('delete')
            ->requiresConfirmation()
            ->action(fn () => $this->post->delete());
    }
    
    // This method name also works, since the action name is `delete`:
    // public function delete(): Action
    
    // This method name does not work, since the action name is `delete`, not `deletePost`:
    // public function deletePost(): Action

    // ...
}
```

Finally, you need to render the action in your view. To do this, you can use `{{ $this->deleteAction }}`, where you replace `deleteAction` with the name of your action method:

```blade
<div>
    {{ $this->deleteAction }}

    <x-filament-actions::modals />
</div>
```

You also need `<x-filament-actions::modals />` which injects the HTML required to render action modals. This only needs to be included within the Livewire component once, regardless of how many actions you have for that component.

## Passing action arguments

Sometimes, you may wish to pass arguments to your action. For example, if you're rendering the same action multiple times in the same view, but each time for a different model, you could pass the model ID as an argument, and then retrieve it later. To do this, you can invoke the action in your view and pass in the arguments as an array:

```php
<div>
    @foreach ($posts as $post)
        <h2>{{ $post->title }}</h2>

        {{ ($this->deleteAction)(['post' => $post->id]) }}
    @endforeach

    <x-filament-actions::modals />
</div>
```

Now, you can access the post ID in your action method:

```php
use App\Models\Post;
use Filament\Actions\Action;

public function deleteAction(): Action
{
    return Action::make('delete')
        ->requiresConfirmation()
        ->action(function (array $arguments) {
            $post = Post::find($arguments['post']);

            $post?->delete();
        });
}
```

## Hiding actions in a Livewire view

If you use `hidden()` or `visible()` to control if an action is rendered, you should wrap the action in an `@if` check for `isVisible()`:

```blade
<div>
    @if ($this->deleteAction->isVisible())
        {{ $this->deleteAction }}
    @endif
    
    {{-- Or --}}
    
    @if (($this->deleteAction)(['post' => $post->id])->isVisible())
        {{ ($this->deleteAction)(['post' => $post->id]) }}
    @endif
</div>
```

The `hidden()` and `visible()` methods also control if the action is `disabled()`, so they are still useful to protect the action from being run if the user does not have permission. Encapsulating this logic in the `hidden()` or `visible()` of the action itself is good practice otherwise you need to define the condition in the view and in `disabled()`.

You can also take advantage of this to hide any wrapping elements that may not need to be rendered if the action is hidden:

```blade
<div>
    @if ($this->deleteAction->isVisible())
        <div>
            {{ $this->deleteAction }}
        </div>
    @endif
</div>
```

## Grouping actions in a Livewire view

You may [group actions together into a dropdown menu](grouping-actions) by using the `<x-filament-actions::group>` Blade component, passing in the `actions` array as an attribute:

```blade
<div>
    <x-filament-actions::group :actions="[
        $this->editAction,
        $this->viewAction,
        $this->deleteAction,
    ]" />

    <x-filament-actions::modals />
</div>
```

You can also pass in any attributes to customize the appearance of the trigger button and dropdown:

```blade
<div>
    <x-filament-actions::group
        :actions="[
            $this->editAction,
            $this->viewAction,
            $this->deleteAction,
        ]"
        label="Actions"
        icon="heroicon-m-ellipsis-vertical"
        color="primary"
        size="md"
        tooltip="More actions"
        dropdown-placement="bottom-start"
    />

    <x-filament-actions::modals />
</div>
```

## Chaining actions

You can chain multiple actions together, by calling the `replaceMountedAction()` method to replace the current action with another when it has finished:

```php
use App\Models\Post;
use Filament\Actions\Action;

public function editAction(): Action
{
    return Action::make('edit')
        ->form([
            // ...
        ])
        // ...
        ->action(function (array $arguments) {
            $post = Post::find($arguments['post']);

            // ...

            $this->replaceMountedAction('publish', $arguments);
        });
}

public function publishAction(): Action
{
    return Action::make('publish')
        ->requiresConfirmation()
        // ...
        ->action(function (array $arguments) {
            $post = Post::find($arguments['post']);

            $post->publish();
        });
}
```

Now, when the first action is submitted, the second action will open in its place. The [arguments](#passing-action-arguments) that were originally passed to the first action get passed to the second action, so you can use them to persist data between requests.

If the first action is canceled, the second one is not opened. If the second action is canceled, the first one has already run and cannot be cancelled.

## Programmatically triggering actions

Sometimes you may need to trigger an action without the user clicking on the built-in trigger button, especially from JavaScript. Here is an example action which could be registered on a Livewire component:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

public function testAction(): Action
{
    return Action::make('test')
        ->requiresConfirmation()
        ->action(function (array $arguments) {
            dd('Test action called', $arguments);
        });
}
```

You can trigger that action from a click in your HTML using the `wire:click` attribute, calling the `mountAction()` method and optionally passing in any arguments that you want to be available:

```blade
<button wire:click="mountAction('test', { id: 12345 })">
    Button
</button>
```

To trigger that action from JavaScript, you can use the [`$wire` utility](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/alpine#controlling-livewire-from-alpine-using-wire), passing in the same arguments:

```js
$wire.mountAction('test', { id: 12345 })
```

# Documentation for actions. File: 07-prebuilt-actions/01-create.md
---
title: Create action
---

## Overview

Filament includes a prebuilt action that is able to create Eloquent records. When the trigger button is clicked, a modal will open with a form inside. The user fills the form, and that data is validated and saved into the database. You may use it like so:

```php
use Filament\Actions\CreateAction;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

CreateAction::make()
    ->model(Post::class)
    ->form([
        TextInput::make('title')
            ->required()
            ->maxLength(255),
        // ...
    ])
```

If you want to add this action to the header of a table instead, you can use `Filament\Tables\Actions\CreateAction`:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Tables\Actions\CreateAction;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->headerActions([
            CreateAction::make()
                ->form([
                    TextInput::make('title')
                        ->required()
                        ->maxLength(255),
                    // ...
                ]),
        ]);
}
```

## Customizing data before saving

Sometimes, you may wish to modify form data before it is finally saved to the database. To do this, you may use the `mutateFormDataUsing()` method, which has access to the `$data` as an array, and returns the modified version:

```php
CreateAction::make()
    ->mutateFormDataUsing(function (array $data): array {
        $data['user_id'] = auth()->id();

        return $data;
    })
```

## Customizing the creation process

You can tweak how the record is created with the `using()` method:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

CreateAction::make()
    ->using(function (array $data, string $model): Model {
        return $model::create($data);
    })
```

`$model` is the class name of the model, but you can replace this with your own hard-coded class if you wish.

## Redirecting after creation

You may set up a custom redirect when the form is submitted using the `successRedirectUrl()` method:

```php
CreateAction::make()
    ->successRedirectUrl(route('posts.list'))
```

If you want to redirect using the created record, use the `$record` parameter:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

CreateAction::make()
    ->successRedirectUrl(fn (Model $record): string => route('posts.edit', [
        'post' => $record,
    ]))
```

## Customizing the save notification

When the record is successfully created, a notification is dispatched to the user, which indicates the success of their action.

To customize the title of this notification, use the `successNotificationTitle()` method:

```php
CreateAction::make()
    ->successNotificationTitle('User registered')
```

You may customize the entire notification using the `successNotification()` method:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

CreateAction::make()
    ->successNotification(
       Notification::make()
            ->success()
            ->title('User registered')
            ->body('The user has been created successfully.'),
    )
```

To disable the notification altogether, use the `successNotification(null)` method:

```php
CreateAction::make()
    ->successNotification(null)
```

## Lifecycle hooks

Hooks may be used to execute code at various points within the action's lifecycle, like before a form is saved.

There are several available hooks:

```php
CreateAction::make()
    ->beforeFormFilled(function () {
        // Runs before the form fields are populated with their default values.
    })
    ->afterFormFilled(function () {
        // Runs after the form fields are populated with their default values.
    })
    ->beforeFormValidated(function () {
        // Runs before the form fields are validated when the form is submitted.
    })
    ->afterFormValidated(function () {
        // Runs after the form fields are validated when the form is submitted.
    })
    ->before(function () {
        // Runs before the form fields are saved to the database.
    })
    ->after(function () {
        // Runs after the form fields are saved to the database.
    })
```

## Halting the creation process

At any time, you may call `$action->halt()` from inside a lifecycle hook or mutation method, which will halt the entire creation process:

```php
use App\Models\Post;
use Filament\Notifications\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

CreateAction::make()
    ->before(function (CreateAction $action, Post $record) {
        if (! $record->team->subscribed()) {
            Notification::make()
                ->warning()
                ->title('You don\'t have an active subscription!')
                ->body('Choose a plan to continue.')
                ->persistent()
                ->actions([
                    Action::make('subscribe')
                        ->button()
                        ->url(route('subscribe'), shouldOpenInNewTab: true),
                ])
                ->send();
        
            $action->halt();
        }
    })
```

If you'd like the action modal to close too, you can completely `cancel()` the action instead of halting it:

```php
$action->cancel();
```

## Using a wizard

You may easily transform the creation process into a multistep wizard. Instead of using a `form()`, define a `steps()` array and pass your `Step` objects:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\MarkdownEditor;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Toggle;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Wizard\Step;

CreateAction::make()
    ->steps([
        Step::make('Name')
            ->description('Give the category a unique name')
            ->schema([
                TextInput::make('name')
                    ->required()
                    ->live()
                    ->afterStateUpdated(fn ($state, callable $set) => $set('slug', Str::slug($state))),
                TextInput::make('slug')
                    ->disabled()
                    ->required()
                    ->unique(Category::class, 'slug'),
            ])
            ->columns(2),
        Step::make('Description')
            ->description('Add some extra details')
            ->schema([
                MarkdownEditor::make('description'),
            ]),
        Step::make('Visibility')
            ->description('Control who can view it')
            ->schema([
                Toggle::make('is_visible')
                    ->label('Visible to customers.')
                    ->default(true),
            ]),
    ])
```

Now, create a new record to see your wizard in action! Edit will still use the form defined within the resource class.

If you'd like to allow free navigation, so all the steps are skippable, use the `skippableSteps()` method:

```php
CreateAction::make()
    ->steps([
        // ...
    ])
    ->skippableSteps()
```

## Disabling create another

If you'd like to remove the "create another" button from the modal, you can use the `createAnother(false)` method:

```php
CreateAction::make()
    ->createAnother(false)
```

# Documentation for actions. File: 07-prebuilt-actions/02-edit.md
---
title: Edit action
---

## Overview

Filament includes a prebuilt action that is able to edit Eloquent records. When the trigger button is clicked, a modal will open with a form inside. The user fills the form, and that data is validated and saved into the database. You may use it like so:

```php
use Filament\Actions\EditAction;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

EditAction::make()
    ->record($this->post)
    ->form([
        TextInput::make('title')
            ->required()
            ->maxLength(255),
        // ...
    ])
```

If you want to edit table rows, you can use the `Filament\Tables\Actions\EditAction` instead:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Tables\Actions\EditAction;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->actions([
            EditAction::make()
                ->form([
                    TextInput::make('title')
                        ->required()
                        ->maxLength(255),
                    // ...
                ]),
        ]);
}
```

## Customizing data before filling the form

You may wish to modify the data from a record before it is filled into the form. To do this, you may use the `mutateRecordDataUsing()` method to modify the `$data` array, and return the modified version before it is filled into the form:

```php
EditAction::make()
    ->mutateRecordDataUsing(function (array $data): array {
        $data['user_id'] = auth()->id();

        return $data;
    })
```

## Customizing data before saving

Sometimes, you may wish to modify form data before it is finally saved to the database. To do this, you may use the `mutateFormDataUsing()` method, which has access to the `$data` as an array, and returns the modified version:

```php
EditAction::make()
    ->mutateFormDataUsing(function (array $data): array {
        $data['last_edited_by_id'] = auth()->id();

        return $data;
    })
```

## Customizing the saving process

You can tweak how the record is updated with the `using()` method:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

EditAction::make()
    ->using(function (Model $record, array $data): Model {
        $record->update($data);

        return $record;
    })
```

## Redirecting after saving

You may set up a custom redirect when the form is submitted using the `successRedirectUrl()` method:

```php
EditAction::make()
    ->successRedirectUrl(route('posts.list'))
```

If you want to redirect using the created record, use the `$record` parameter:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

EditAction::make()
    ->successRedirectUrl(fn (Model $record): string => route('posts.view', [
        'post' => $record,
    ]))
```

## Customizing the save notification

When the record is successfully updated, a notification is dispatched to the user, which indicates the success of their action.

To customize the title of this notification, use the `successNotificationTitle()` method:

```php
EditAction::make()
    ->successNotificationTitle('User updated')
```

You may customize the entire notification using the `successNotification()` method:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

EditAction::make()
    ->successNotification(
       Notification::make()
            ->success()
            ->title('User updated')
            ->body('The user has been saved successfully.'),
    )
```

To disable the notification altogether, use the `successNotification(null)` method:

```php
EditAction::make()
    ->successNotification(null)
```

## Lifecycle hooks

Hooks may be used to execute code at various points within the action's lifecycle, like before a form is saved.

There are several available hooks:

```php
EditAction::make()
    ->beforeFormFilled(function () {
        // Runs before the form fields are populated from the database.
    })
    ->afterFormFilled(function () {
        // Runs after the form fields are populated from the database.
    })
    ->beforeFormValidated(function () {
        // Runs before the form fields are validated when the form is saved.
    })
    ->afterFormValidated(function () {
        // Runs after the form fields are validated when the form is saved.
    })
    ->before(function () {
        // Runs before the form fields are saved to the database.
    })
    ->after(function () {
        // Runs after the form fields are saved to the database.
    })
```

        if (! $record->team->subscribed()) {
            Notification::make()
                ->warning()
                ->title('You don\'t have an active subscription!')
                ->body('Choose a plan to continue.')
                ->persistent()
                ->actions([
                    Action::make('subscribe')
                        ->button()
                        ->url(route('subscribe'), shouldOpenInNewTab: true),
                ])
                ->send();
        
            $action->halt();
        }
    })
```

If you'd like the action modal to close too, you can completely `cancel()` the action instead of halting it:

```php
$action->cancel();
```

# Documentation for actions. File: 07-prebuilt-actions/03-view.md
---
title: View action
---

## Overview

Filament includes a prebuilt action that is able to view Eloquent records. When the trigger button is clicked, a modal will open with information inside. Filament uses form fields to structure this information. All form fields are disabled, so they are not editable by the user. You may use it like so:

```php
use Filament\Actions\ViewAction;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

ViewAction::make()
    ->record($this->post)
    ->form([
        TextInput::make('title')
            ->required()
            ->maxLength(255),
        // ...
    ])
```

If you want to view table rows, you can use the `Filament\Tables\Actions\ViewAction` instead:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Tables\Actions\ViewAction;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->actions([
            ViewAction::make()
                ->form([
                    TextInput::make('title')
                        ->required()
                        ->maxLength(255),
                    // ...
                ]),
        ]);
}
```

## Customizing data before filling the form

You may wish to modify the data from a record before it is filled into the form. To do this, you may use the `mutateRecordDataUsing()` method to modify the `$data` array, and return the modified version before it is filled into the form:

```php
ViewAction::make()
    ->mutateRecordDataUsing(function (array $data): array {
        $data['user_id'] = auth()->id();

        return $data;
    })
```
# Documentation for actions. File: 07-prebuilt-actions/04-delete.md
---
title: Delete action
---

## Overview

Filament includes a prebuilt action that is able to delete Eloquent records. When the trigger button is clicked, a modal asks the user for confirmation. You may use it like so:

```php
use Filament\Actions\DeleteAction;

DeleteAction::make()
    ->record($this->post)
```

If you want to delete table rows, you can use the `Filament\Tables\Actions\DeleteAction` instead, or `Filament\Tables\Actions\DeleteBulkAction` to delete multiple at once:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Actions\BulkActionGroup;
use Filament\Tables\Actions\DeleteAction;
use Filament\Tables\Actions\DeleteBulkAction;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->actions([
            DeleteAction::make(),
            // ...
        ])
        ->bulkActions([
            BulkActionGroup::make([
                DeleteBulkAction::make(),
                // ...
            ]),
        ]);
}
```

## Redirecting after deleting

You may set up a custom redirect when the form is submitted using the `successRedirectUrl()` method:

```php
DeleteAction::make()
    ->successRedirectUrl(route('posts.list'))
```

## Customizing the delete notification

When the record is successfully deleted, a notification is dispatched to the user, which indicates the success of their action.

To customize the title of this notification, use the `successNotificationTitle()` method:

```php
DeleteAction::make()
    ->successNotificationTitle('User deleted')
```

You may customize the entire notification using the `successNotification()` method:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

DeleteAction::make()
    ->successNotification(
       Notification::make()
            ->success()
            ->title('User deleted')
            ->body('The user has been deleted successfully.'),
    )
```

To disable the notification altogether, use the `successNotification(null)` method:

```php
DeleteAction::make()
    ->successNotification(null)
```

## Lifecycle hooks

You can use the `before()` and `after()` methods to execute code before and after a record is deleted:

```php
DeleteAction::make()
    ->before(function () {
        // ...
    })
    ->after(function () {
        // ...
    })
```

# Documentation for actions. File: 07-prebuilt-actions/05-replicate.md
---
title: Replicate action
---

## Overview

Filament includes a prebuilt action that is able to [replicate](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent#replicating-models) Eloquent records. You may use it like so:

```php
use Filament\Actions\ReplicateAction;

ReplicateAction::make()
    ->record($this->post)
```

If you want to replicate table rows, you can use the `Filament\Tables\Actions\ReplicateAction` instead:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Actions\ReplicateAction;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->actions([
            ReplicateAction::make(),
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

## Excluding attributes

The `excludeAttributes()` method is used to instruct the action which columns should be excluded from replication:

```php
ReplicateAction::make()
    ->excludeAttributes(['slug'])
```

## Customizing data before filling the form

You may wish to modify the data from a record before it is filled into the form. To do this, you may use the `mutateRecordDataUsing()` method to modify the `$data` array, and return the modified version before it is filled into the form:

```php
ReplicateAction::make()
    ->mutateRecordDataUsing(function (array $data): array {
        $data['user_id'] = auth()->id();

        return $data;
    })
```

## Redirecting after replication

You may set up a custom redirect when the form is submitted using the `successRedirectUrl()` method:

```php
ReplicateAction::make()
    ->successRedirectUrl(route('posts.list'))
```

If you want to redirect using the replica, use the `$replica` parameter:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

ReplicateAction::make()
    ->successRedirectUrl(fn (Model $replica): string => route('posts.edit', [
        'post' => $replica,
    ]))
```

## Customizing the replicate notification

When the record is successfully replicated, a notification is dispatched to the user, which indicates the success of their action.

To customize the title of this notification, use the `successNotificationTitle()` method:

```php
ReplicateAction::make()
    ->successNotificationTitle('Category replicated')
```

You may customize the entire notification using the `successNotification()` method:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

ReplicateAction::make()
    ->successNotification(
       Notification::make()
            ->success()
            ->title('Category replicated')
            ->body('The category has been replicated successfully.'),
    )
```

## Lifecycle hooks

Hooks may be used to execute code at various points within the action's lifecycle, like before the replica is saved.

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

ReplicateAction::make()
    ->before(function () {
        // Runs before the record has been replicated.
    })
    ->beforeReplicaSaved(function (Model $replica): void {
        // Runs after the record has been replicated but before it is saved to the database.
    })
    ->after(function (Model $replica): void {
        // Runs after the replica has been saved to the database.
    })
```

## Halting the replication process

At any time, you may call `$action->halt()` from inside a lifecycle hook, which will halt the entire replication process:

```php
use App\Models\Post;
use Filament\Notifications\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

ReplicateAction::make()
    ->before(function (ReplicateAction $action, Post $record) {
        if (! $record->team->subscribed()) {
            Notification::make()
                ->warning()
                ->title('You don\'t have an active subscription!')
                ->body('Choose a plan to continue.')
                ->persistent()
                ->actions([
                    Action::make('subscribe')
                        ->button()
                        ->url(route('subscribe'), shouldOpenInNewTab: true),
                ])
                ->send();
        
            $action->halt();
        }
    })
```

If you'd like the action modal to close too, you can completely `cancel()` the action instead of halting it:

```php
$action->cancel();
```

## Overview

Filament includes a prebuilt action that is able to force-delete [soft deleted](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent#soft-deleting) Eloquent records. When the trigger button is clicked, a modal asks the user for confirmation. You may use it like so:

```php
use Filament\Actions\ForceDeleteAction;

ForceDeleteAction::make()
    ->record($this->post)
```

If you want to force-delete table rows, you can use the `Filament\Tables\Actions\ForceDeleteAction` instead, or `Filament\Tables\Actions\ForceDeleteBulkAction` to force-delete multiple at once:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Actions\BulkActionGroup;
use Filament\Tables\Actions\ForceDeleteAction;
use Filament\Tables\Actions\ForceDeleteBulkAction;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->actions([
            ForceDeleteAction::make(),
            // ...
        ])
        ->bulkActions([
            BulkActionGroup::make([
                ForceDeleteBulkAction::make(),
                // ...
            ]),
        ]);
}
```

## Redirecting after force-deleting

You may set up a custom redirect when the form is submitted using the `successRedirectUrl()` method:

```php
ForceDeleteAction::make()
    ->successRedirectUrl(route('posts.list'))
```

## Customizing the force-delete notification

When the record is successfully force-deleted, a notification is dispatched to the user, which indicates the success of their action.

To customize the title of this notification, use the `successNotificationTitle()` method:

```php
ForceDeleteAction::make()
    ->successNotificationTitle('User force-deleted')
```

You may customize the entire notification using the `successNotification()` method:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

ForceDeleteAction::make()
    ->successNotification(
       Notification::make()
            ->success()
            ->title('User force-deleted')
            ->body('The user has been force-deleted successfully.'),
    )
```

To disable the notification altogether, use the `successNotification(null)` method:

```php
ForceDeleteAction::make()
    ->successNotification(null)
```

## Lifecycle hooks

You can use the `before()` and `after()` methods to execute code before and after a record is force-deleted:

```php
ForceDeleteAction::make()
    ->before(function () {
        // ...
    })
    ->after(function () {
        // ...
    })
```

title: Restore action
---

## Overview

Filament includes a prebuilt action that is able to restore [soft deleted](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent#soft-deleting) Eloquent records. When the trigger button is clicked, a modal asks the user for confirmation. You may use it like so:

```php
use Filament\Actions\RestoreAction;

RestoreAction::make()
    ->record($this->post)
```

If you want to restore table rows, you can use the `Filament\Tables\Actions\RestoreAction` instead, or `Filament\Tables\Actions\RestoreBulkAction` to restore multiple at once:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Actions\BulkActionGroup;
use Filament\Tables\Actions\RestoreAction;
use Filament\Tables\Actions\RestoreBulkAction;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->actions([
            RestoreAction::make(),
            // ...
        ])
        ->bulkActions([
            BulkActionGroup::make([
                RestoreBulkAction::make(),
                // ...
            ]),
        ]);
}
```

## Redirecting after restoring

You may set up a custom redirect when the form is submitted using the `successRedirectUrl()` method:

```php
RestoreAction::make()
    ->successRedirectUrl(route('posts.list'))
```

## Customizing the restore notification

When the record is successfully restored, a notification is dispatched to the user, which indicates the success of their action.

To customize the title of this notification, use the `successNotificationTitle()` method:

```php
RestoreAction::make()
    ->successNotificationTitle('User restored')
```

You may customize the entire notification using the `successNotification()` method:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

RestoreAction::make()
    ->successNotification(
       Notification::make()
            ->success()
            ->title('User restored')
            ->body('The user has been restored successfully.'),
    )
```

To disable the notification altogether, use the `successNotification(null)` method:

```php
RestoreAction::make()
    ->successNotification(null)
```

## Lifecycle hooks

You can use the `before()` and `after()` methods to execute code before and after a record is restored:

```php
RestoreAction::make()
    ->before(function () {
        // ...
    })
    ->after(function () {
        // ...
    })
```

# Documentation for actions. File: 07-prebuilt-actions/08-import.md

title: Import action
---

## Overview

Filament v3.1 introduced a prebuilt action that is able to import rows from a CSV. When the trigger button is clicked, a modal asks the user for a file. Once they upload one, they are able to map each column in the CSV to a real column in the database. If any rows fail validation, they will be compiled into a downloadable CSV for the user to review after the rest of the rows have been imported. Users can also download an example CSV file containing all the columns that can be imported.

This feature uses [job batches](https://laravel.com/docs/queues#job-batching) and [database notifications](../../notifications/database-notifications#overview), so you need to publish those migrations from Laravel. Also, you need to publish the migrations for tables that Filament uses to store information about imports:

```bash
# Laravel 11 and higher
php artisan make:queue-batches-table
php artisan make:notifications-table

# Laravel 10
php artisan queue:batches-table
php artisan notifications:table
```

```bash
# All apps
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=filament-actions-migrations
php artisan migrate
```

> If you're using PostgreSQL, make sure that the `data` column in the notifications migration is using `json()`: `$table->json('data')`.

> If you're using UUIDs for your `User` model, make sure that your `notifiable` column in the notifications migration is using `uuidMorphs()`: `$table->uuidMorphs('notifiable')`.

You may use the `ImportAction` like so:

```php
use App\Filament\Imports\ProductImporter;
use Filament\Actions\ImportAction;

ImportAction::make()
    ->importer(ProductImporter::class)
```

If you want to add this action to the header of a table instead, you can use `Filament\Tables\Actions\ImportAction`:

```php
use App\Filament\Imports\ProductImporter;
use Filament\Tables\Actions\ImportAction;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->headerActions([
            ImportAction::make()
                ->importer(ProductImporter::class)
        ]);
}
```

The ["importer" class needs to be created](#creating-an-importer) to tell Filament how to import each row of the CSV.

If you have more than one `ImportAction` in the same place, you should give each a unique name in the `make()` method:

```php
ImportAction::make('importProducts')
    ->importer(ProductImporter::class)

ImportAction::make('importBrands')
    ->importer(BrandImporter::class)
```

## Creating an importer

To create an importer class for a model, you may use the `make:filament-importer` command, passing the name of a model:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-importer Product
```

This will create a new class in the `app/Filament/Imports` directory. You now need to define the [columns](#defining-importer-columns) that can be imported.

### Automatically generating importer columns

If you'd like to save time, Filament can automatically generate the [columns](#defining-importer-columns) for you, based on your model's database columns, using `--generate`:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-importer Product --generate
```

## Defining importer columns

To define the columns that can be imported, you need to override the `getColumns()` method on your importer class, returning an array of `ImportColumn` objects:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Imports\ImportColumn;

public static function getColumns(): array
{
    return [
        ImportColumn::make('name')
            ->requiredMapping()
            ->rules(['required', 'max:255']),
        ImportColumn::make('sku')
            ->label('SKU')
            ->requiredMapping()
            ->rules(['required', 'max:32']),
        ImportColumn::make('price')
            ->numeric()
            ->rules(['numeric', 'min:0']),
    ];
}
```

### Customizing the label of an import column

The label for each column will be generated automatically from its name, but you can override it by calling the `label()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Imports\ImportColumn;

ImportColumn::make('sku')
    ->label('SKU')
```

### Requiring an importer column to be mapped to a CSV column

You can call the `requiredMapping()` method to make a column required to be mapped to a column in the CSV. Columns that are required in the database should be required to be mapped:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Imports\ImportColumn;

ImportColumn::make('sku')
    ->requiredMapping()
```

If you require a column in the database, you also need to make sure that it has a [`rules(['required'])` validation rule](#validating-csv-data).

If a column is not mapped, it will not be validated since there is no data to validate.

If you allow an import to create records as well as [update existing ones](#updating-existing-records-when-importing), but only require a column to be mapped when creating records as it's a required field, you can use the `requiredMappingForNewRecordsOnly()` method instead of `requiredMapping()`:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Imports\ImportColumn;

ImportColumn::make('sku')
    ->requiredMappingForNewRecordsOnly()
```

If the `resolveRecord()` method returns a model instance that is not saved in the database yet, the column will be required to be mapped, just for that row. If the user does not map the column, and one of the rows in the import does not yet exist in the database, just that row will fail and a message will be added to the failed rows CSV after every row has been analyzed.

### Validating CSV data

You can call the `rules()` method to add validation rules to a column. These rules will check the data in each row from the CSV before it is saved to the database:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Imports\ImportColumn;

ImportColumn::make('sku')
    ->rules(['required', 'max:32'])
```

Any rows that do not pass validation will not be imported. Instead, they will be compiled into a new CSV of "failed rows", which the user can download after the import has finished. The user will be shown a list of validation errors for each row that failed.

### Casting state

Before [validation](#validating-csv-data), data from the CSV can be cast. This is useful for converting strings into the correct data type, otherwise validation may fail. For example, if you have a `price` column in your CSV, you may want to cast it to a float:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Imports\ImportColumn;

ImportColumn::make('price')
    ->castStateUsing(function (string $state): ?float {
        if (blank($state)) {
            return null;
        }
        
        $state = preg_replace('/[^0-9.]/', '', $state);
        $state = floatval($state);
    
        return round($state, precision: 2);
    })
```

In this example, we pass in a function that is used to cast the `$state`. This function removes any non-numeric characters from the string, casts it to a float, and rounds it to two decimal places.

> Please note: if a column is not [required by validation](#validating-csv-data), and it is empty, it will not be cast.

Filament also ships with some built-in casting methods:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Imports\ImportColumn;

ImportColumn::make('price')
    ->numeric() // Casts the state to a float.

ImportColumn::make('price')
    ->numeric(decimalPlaces: 2) // Casts the state to a float, and rounds it to 2 decimal places.

ImportColumn::make('quantity')
    ->integer() // Casts the state to an integer.

ImportColumn::make('is_visible')
    ->boolean() // Casts the state to a boolean.
```

#### Mutating the state after it has been cast

If you're using a [built-in casting method](#casting-state) or [array cast](#handling-multiple-values-in-a-single-column-as-an-array), you can mutate the state after it has been cast by passing a function to the `castStateUsing()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Imports\ImportColumn;

ImportColumn::make('price')
    ->numeric()
    ->castStateUsing(function (float $state): ?float {
        if (blank($state)) {
            return null;
        }
    
        return round($state * 100);
    })
```

You can even access the original state before it was cast, by defining an `$originalState` argument in the function:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Imports\ImportColumn;

ImportColumn::make('price')
    ->numeric()
    ->castStateUsing(function (float $state, mixed $originalState): ?float {
        // ...
    })
```

### Importing relationships

You may use the `relationship()` method to import a relationship. At the moment, only `BelongsTo` relationships are supported. For example, if you have a `category` column in your CSV, you may want to import the category relationship:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Imports\ImportColumn;

ImportColumn::make('author')
    ->relationship()
```

In this example, the `author` column in the CSV will be mapped to the `author_id` column in the database. The CSV should contain the primary keys of authors, usually `id`.

If the column has a value, but the author cannot be found, the import will fail validation. Filament automatically adds validation to all relationship columns, to ensure that the relationship is not empty when it is required.

#### Customizing the relationship import resolution

If you want to find a related record using a different column, you can pass the column name as `resolveUsing`:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Imports\ImportColumn;

ImportColumn::make('author')
    ->relationship(resolveUsing: 'email')
```

You can pass in multiple columns to `resolveUsing`, and they will be used to find the author, in an "or" fashion. For example, if you pass in `['email', 'username']`, the record can be found by either their email or username:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Imports\ImportColumn;

ImportColumn::make('author')
    ->relationship(resolveUsing: ['email', 'username'])
```

You can also customize the resolution process, by passing in a function to `resolveUsing`, which should return a record to associate with the relationship:

```php
use App\Models\Author;
use Filament\Actions\Imports\ImportColumn;

ImportColumn::make('author')
    ->relationship(resolveUsing: function (string $state): ?Author {
        return Author::query()
            ->where('email', $state)
            ->orWhere('username', $state)
            ->first();
    })
```

You could even use this function to dynamically determine which columns to use to resolve the record:

```php
use App\Models\Author;
use Filament\Actions\Imports\ImportColumn;

ImportColumn::make('author')
    ->relationship(resolveUsing: function (string $state): ?Author {
        if (filter_var($state, FILTER_VALIDATE_EMAIL)) {
            return 'email';
        }
    
        return 'username';
    })
```

### Handling multiple values in a single column as an array

You may use the `array()` method to cast the values in a column to an array. It accepts a delimiter as its first argument, which is used to split the values in the column into an array. For example, if you have a `documentation_urls` column in your CSV, you may want to cast it to an array of URLs:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Imports\ImportColumn;

ImportColumn::make('documentation_urls')
    ->array(',')
```

In this example, we pass in a comma as the delimiter, so the values in the column will be split by commas, and cast to an array.

#### Casting each item in an array

If you want to cast each item in the array to a different data type, you can chain the [built-in casting methods](#casting-state):

```php
use Filament\Actions\Imports\ImportColumn;

ImportColumn::make('customer_ratings')
    ->array(',')
    ->integer() // Casts each item in the array to an integer.
```

#### Validating each item in an array

If you want to validate each item in the array, you can chain the `nestedRecursiveRules()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Imports\ImportColumn;

ImportColumn::make('customer_ratings')
    ->array(',')
    ->integer()
    ->rules(['array'])
    ->nestedRecursiveRules(['integer', 'min:1', 'max:5'])
```

### Marking column data as sensitive

When import rows fail validation, they are logged to the database, ready for export when the import completes. You may want to exclude certain columns from this logging to avoid storing sensitive data in plain text. To achieve this, you can use the `sensitive()` method on the `ImportColumn` to prevent its data from being logged:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Imports\ImportColumn;

ImportColumn::make('ssn')
    ->label('Social security number')
    ->sensitive()
    ->rules(['required', 'digits:9'])
```

### Customizing how a column is filled into a record

If you want to customize how column state is filled into a record, you can pass a function to the `fillRecordUsing()` method:

```php
use App\Models\Product;

ImportColumn::make('sku')
    ->fillRecordUsing(function (Product $record, string $state): void {
        $record->sku = strtoupper($state);
    })
```

### Adding helper text below the import column

Sometimes, you may wish to provide extra information for the user before validation. You can do this by adding `helperText()` to a column, which gets displayed below the mapping select:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

ImportColumn::make('skus')
    ->array(',')
    ->helperText('A comma-separated list of SKUs.')
```

## Updating existing records when importing

When generating an importer class, you will see this `resolveRecord()` method:

```php
use App\Models\Product;

public function resolveRecord(): ?Product
{
    // return Product::firstOrNew([
    //     // Update existing records, matching them by `$this->data['column_name']`
    //     'email' => $this->data['email'],
    // ]);

    return new Product();
}
```

This method is called for each row in the CSV, and is responsible for returning a model instance that will be filled with the data from the CSV, and saved to the database. By default, it will create a new record for each row. However, you can customize this behavior to update existing records instead. For example, you might want to update a product if it already exists, and create a new one if it doesn't. To do this, you can uncomment the `firstOrNew()` line, and pass the column name that you want to match on. For a product, we might want to match on the `sku` column:

```php
use App\Models\Product;

public function resolveRecord(): ?Product
{
    return Product::firstOrNew([
        'sku' => $this->data['sku'],
    ]);
}
```

### Updating existing records when importing only

If you want to write an importer that only updates existing records, and does not create new ones, you can return `null` if no record is found:

```php
use App\Models\Product;

public function resolveRecord(): ?Product
{
    return Product::query()
        ->where('sku', $this->data['sku'])
        ->first();
}
```

If you'd like to fail the import row if no record is found, you can throw a `RowImportFailedException` with a message:

```php
use App\Models\Product;
use Filament\Actions\Imports\Exceptions\RowImportFailedException;

public function resolveRecord(): ?Product
{
    $product = Product::query()
        ->where('sku', $this->data['sku'])
        ->first();

    if (! $product) {
        throw new RowImportFailedException("No product found with SKU [{$this->data['sku']}].");
    }

    return $product;
}
```

When the import is completed, the user will be able to download a CSV of failed rows, which will contain the error messages.

### Ignoring blank state for an import column

By default, if a column in the CSV is blank, and mapped by the user, and it's not required by validation, the column will be imported as `null` in the database. If you'd like to ignore blank state, and use the existing value in the database instead, you can call the `ignoreBlankState()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Imports\ImportColumn;

ImportColumn::make('price')
    ->ignoreBlankState()
```

## Using import options

The import action can render extra form components that the user can interact with when importing a CSV. This can be useful to allow the user to customize the behavior of the importer. For instance, you might want a user to be able to choose whether to update existing records when importing, or only create new ones. To do this, you can return options form components from the `getOptionsFormComponents()` method on your importer class:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Checkbox;

public static function getOptionsFormComponents(): array
{
    return [
        Checkbox::make('updateExisting')
            ->label('Update existing records'),
    ];
}
```

Alternatively, you can pass a set of static options to the importer through the `options()` method on the action:

```php
use Filament\Actions\ImportAction;

ImportAction::make()
    ->importer(ProductImporter::class)
    ->options([
        'updateExisting' => true,
    ])
```

Now, you can access the data from these options inside the importer class, by calling `$this->options`. For example, you might want to use it inside `resolveRecord()` to [update an existing product](#updating-existing-records-when-importing):

```php
use App\Models\Product;

public function resolveRecord(): ?Product
{
    if ($this->options['updateExisting'] ?? false) {
        return Product::firstOrNew([
            'sku' => $this->data['sku'],
        ]);
    }

    return new Product();
}
```

## Improving import column mapping guesses

By default, Filament will attempt to "guess" which columns in the CSV match which columns in the database, to save the user time. It does this by attempting to find different combinations of the column name, with spaces, `-`, `_`, all cases insensitively. However, if you'd like to improve the guesses, you can call the `guess()` method with more examples of the column name that could be present in the CSV:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Imports\ImportColumn;

ImportColumn::make('sku')
    ->guess(['id', 'number', 'stock-keeping unit'])
```

## Providing example CSV data

Before the user uploads a CSV, they have an option to download an example CSV file, containing all the available columns that can be imported. This is useful, as it allows the user to import this file directly into their spreadsheet software, and fill it out.

You can also add an example row to the CSV, to show the user what the data should look like. To fill in this example row, you can pass in an example column value to the `example()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Imports\ImportColumn;

ImportColumn::make('sku')
    ->example('ABC123')
```

Or if you want to add more than one example row, you can pass an array to the `examples()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Imports\ImportColumn;

ImportColumn::make('sku')
    ->examples(['ABC123', 'DEF456'])
```

By default, the name of the column is used in the header of the example CSV. You can customize the header per-column using `exampleHeader()`:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Imports\ImportColumn;

ImportColumn::make('sku')
    ->exampleHeader('SKU')
```

## Using a custom user model

By default, the `imports` table has a `user_id` column. That column is constrained to the `users` table:

```php
$table->foreignId('user_id')->constrained()->cascadeOnDelete();
```

In the `Import` model, the `user()` relationship is defined as a `BelongsTo` relationship to the `App\Models\User` model. If the `App\Models\User` model does not exist, or you want to use a different one, you can bind a new `Authenticatable` model to the container in a service provider's `register()` method:

```php
use App\Models\Admin;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Auth\Authenticatable;

$this->app->bind(Authenticatable::class, Admin::class);
```

If your authenticatable model uses a different table to `users`, you should pass that table name to `constrained()`:

```php
$table->foreignId('user_id')->constrained('admins')->cascadeOnDelete();
```

### Using a polymorphic user relationship

If you want to associate imports with multiple user models, you can use a polymorphic `MorphTo` relationship instead. To do this, you need to replace the `user_id` column in the `imports` table:

```php
$table->morphs('user');
```

Then, in a service provider's `boot()` method, you should call `Import::polymorphicUserRelationship()` to swap the `user()` relationship on the `Import` model to a `MorphTo` relationship:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Imports\Models\Import;

Import::polymorphicUserRelationship();
```

## Limiting the maximum number of rows that can be imported

To prevent server overload, you may wish to limit the maximum number of rows that can be imported from one CSV file. You can do this by calling the `maxRows()` method on the action:

```php
ImportAction::make()
    ->importer(ProductImporter::class)
    ->maxRows(100000)
```

## Changing the import chunk size

Filament will chunk the CSV, and process each chunk in a different queued job. By default, chunks are 100 rows at a time. You can change this by calling the `chunkSize()` method on the action:

```php
ImportAction::make()
    ->importer(ProductImporter::class)
    ->chunkSize(250)
```

If you are encountering memory or timeout issues when importing large CSV files, you may wish to reduce the chunk size.

## Changing the CSV delimiter

The default delimiter for CSVs is the comma (`,`). If your import uses a different delimiter, you may call the `csvDelimiter()` method on the action, passing a new one:

```php
ImportAction::make()
    ->importer(ProductImporter::class)
    ->csvDelimiter(';')
```

You can only specify a single character, otherwise an exception will be thrown.

## Changing the column header offset

If your column headers are not on the first row of the CSV, you can call the `headerOffset()` method on the action, passing the number of rows to skip:

```php
ImportAction::make()
    ->importer(ProductImporter::class)
    ->headerOffset(5)
```

## Customizing the import job

The default job for processing imports is `Filament\Actions\Imports\Jobs\ImportCsv`. If you want to extend this class and override any of its methods, you may replace the original class in the `register()` method of a service provider:

```php
use App\Jobs\ImportCsv;
use Filament\Actions\Imports\Jobs\ImportCsv as BaseImportCsv;

$this->app->bind(BaseImportCsv::class, ImportCsv::class);
```

Or, you can pass the new job class to the `job()` method on the action, to customize the job for a specific import:

```php
use App\Jobs\ImportCsv;

ImportAction::make()
    ->importer(ProductImporter::class)
    ->job(ImportCsv::class)
```

### Customizing the import queue and connection

By default, the import system will use the default queue and connection. If you'd like to customize the queue used for jobs of a certain importer, you may override the `getJobQueue()` method in your importer class:

```php
public function getJobQueue(): ?string
{
    return 'imports';
}
```

You can also customize the connection used for jobs of a certain importer, by overriding the `getJobConnection()` method in your importer class:

```php
public function getJobConnection(): ?string
{
    return 'sqs';
}
```

### Customizing the import job middleware

By default, the import system will only process one job at a time from each import. This is to prevent the server from being overloaded, and other jobs from being delayed by large imports. That functionality is defined in the `WithoutOverlapping` middleware on the importer class:

```php
public function getJobMiddleware(): array
{
    return [
        (new WithoutOverlapping("import{$this->import->getKey()}"))->expireAfter(600),
    ];
}
```

If you'd like to customize the middleware that is applied to jobs of a certain importer, you may override this method in your importer class. You can read more about job middleware in the [Laravel docs](https://laravel.com/docs/queues#job-middleware).

### Customizing the import job retries

By default, the import system will retry a job for 24 hours. This is to allow for temporary issues, such as the database being unavailable, to be resolved. That functionality is defined in the `getJobRetryUntil()` method on the importer class:

```php
use Carbon\CarbonInterface;

public function getJobRetryUntil(): ?CarbonInterface
{
    return now()->addDay();
}
```

If you'd like to customize the retry time for jobs of a certain importer, you may override this method in your importer class. You can read more about job retries in the [Laravel docs](https://laravel.com/docs/queues#time-based-attempts).

### Customizing the import job tags

By default, the import system will tag each job with the ID of the import. This is to allow you to easily find all jobs related to a certain import. That functionality is defined in the `getJobTags()` method on the importer class:

```php
public function getJobTags(): array
{
    return ["import{$this->import->getKey()}"];
}
```

If you'd like to customize the tags that are applied to jobs of a certain importer, you may override this method in your importer class.

### Customizing the import job batch name

By default, the import system doesn't define any name for the job batches. If you'd like to customize the name that is applied to job batches of a certain importer, you may override the `getJobBatchName()` method in your importer class:

```php
public function getJobBatchName(): ?string
{
    return 'product-import';
}
```

## Customizing import validation messages

The import system will automatically validate the CSV file before it is imported. If there are any errors, the user will be shown a list of them, and the import will not be processed. If you'd like to override any default validation messages, you may do so by overriding the `getValidationMessages()` method on your importer class:

```php
public function getValidationMessages(): array
{
    return [
        'name.required' => 'The name column must not be empty.',
    ];
}
```

To learn more about customizing validation messages, read the [Laravel docs](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#customizing-the-error-messages).

### Customizing import validation attributes

When columns fail validation, their label is used in the error message. To customize the label used in field error messages, use the `validationAttribute()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Imports\ImportColumn;

ImportColumn::make('name')
    ->validationAttribute('full name')
```

## Customizing import file validation

You can add new [Laravel validation rules](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#available-validation-rules) for the import file using the `fileRules()` method:

```php
use Illuminate\Validation\Rules\File;

ImportAction::make()
    ->importer(ProductImporter::class)
    ->fileRules([
        'max:1024',
        // or
        File::types(['csv', 'txt'])->max(1024),
    ]),
```

## Lifecycle hooks

Hooks may be used to execute code at various points within an importer's lifecycle, like before a record is saved. To set up a hook, create a protected method on the importer class with the name of the hook:

```php
protected function beforeSave(): void
{
    // ...
}
```

In this example, the code in the `beforeSave()` method will be called before the validated data from the CSV is saved to the database.

There are several available hooks for importers:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Imports\Importer;

class ProductImporter extends Importer
{
    // ...

    protected function beforeValidate(): void
    {
        // Runs before the CSV data for a row is validated.
    }

    protected function afterValidate(): void
    {
        // Runs after the CSV data for a row is validated.
    }

    protected function beforeFill(): void
    {
        // Runs before the validated CSV data for a row is filled into a model instance.
    }

    protected function afterFill(): void
    {
        // Runs after the validated CSV data for a row is filled into a model instance.
    }

    protected function beforeSave(): void
    {
        // Runs before a record is saved to the database.
    }

    protected function beforeCreate(): void
    {
        // Similar to `beforeSave()`, but only runs when creating a new record.
    }

    protected function beforeUpdate(): void
    {
        // Similar to `beforeSave()`, but only runs when updating an existing record.
    }

    protected function afterSave(): void
    {
        // Runs after a record is saved to the database.
    }
    
    protected function afterCreate(): void
    {
        // Similar to `afterSave()`, but only runs when creating a new record.
    }
    
    protected function afterUpdate(): void
    {
        // Similar to `afterSave()`, but only runs when updating an existing record.
    }
}
```

Inside these hooks, you can access the current row's data using `$this->data`. You can also access the original row of data from the CSV, before it was [cast](#casting-state) or mapped, using `$this->originalData`.

The current record (if it exists yet) is accessible in `$this->record`, and the [import form options](#using-import-options) using `$this->options`.

## Authorization

By default, only the user who started the import may access the failure CSV file that gets generated if part of an import fails. If you'd like to customize the authorization logic, you may create an `ImportPolicy` class, and [register it in your `AuthServiceProvider`](https://laravel.com/docs/authorization#registering-policies):

```php
use App\Policies\ImportPolicy;
use Filament\Actions\Imports\Models\Import;

protected $policies = [
    Import::class => ImportPolicy::class,
];
```

The `view()` method of the policy will be used to authorize access to the failure CSV file.

Please note that if you define a policy, the existing logic of ensuring only the user who started the import can access the failure CSV file will be removed. You will need to add that logic to your policy if you want to keep it:

```php
use App\Models\User;
use Filament\Actions\Imports\Models\Import;

public function view(User $user, Import $import): bool
{
    return $import->user()->is($user);
}
```

# Documentation for actions. File: 07-prebuilt-actions/09-export.md
---
title: Export action
---

## Overview

Filament v3.2 introduced a prebuilt action that is able to export rows to a CSV or XLSX file. When the trigger button is clicked, a modal asks for the columns that they want to export, and what they should be labeled. This feature uses [job batches](https://laravel.com/docs/queues#job-batching) and [database notifications](../../notifications/database-notifications#overview), so you need to publish those migrations from Laravel. Also, you need to publish the migrations for tables that Filament uses to store information about exports:

```bash
# Laravel 11 and higher
php artisan make:queue-batches-table
php artisan make:notifications-table

# Laravel 10
php artisan queue:batches-table
php artisan notifications:table
```

```bash
# All apps
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=filament-actions-migrations
php artisan migrate
```

> If you're using PostgreSQL, make sure that the `data` column in the notifications migration is using `json()`: `$table->json('data')`.

> If you're using UUIDs for your `User` model, make sure that your `notifiable` column in the notifications migration is using `uuidMorphs()`: `$table->uuidMorphs('notifiable')`.

You may use the `ExportAction` like so:

```php
use App\Filament\Exports\ProductExporter;
use Filament\Actions\ExportAction;

ExportAction::make()
    ->exporter(ProductExporter::class)
```

If you want to add this action to the header of a table instead, you can use `Filament\Tables\Actions\ExportAction`:

```php
use App\Filament\Exports\ProductExporter;
use Filament\Tables\Actions\ExportAction;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->headerActions([
            ExportAction::make()
                ->exporter(ProductExporter::class)
        ]);
}
```

Or if you want to add it as a table bulk action, so that the user can choose which rows to export, they can use `Filament\Tables\Actions\ExportBulkAction`:

```php
use App\Filament\Exports\ProductExporter;
use Filament\Tables\Actions\ExportBulkAction;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->bulkActions([
            ExportBulkAction::make()
                ->exporter(ProductExporter::class)
        ]);
}
```

The ["exporter" class needs to be created](#creating-an-exporter) to tell Filament how to export each row.

## Creating an exporter

To create an exporter class for a model, you may use the `make:filament-exporter` command, passing the name of a model:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-exporter Product
```

This will create a new class in the `app/Filament/Exports` directory. You now need to define the [columns](#defining-exporter-columns) that can be exported.

### Automatically generating exporter columns

If you'd like to save time, Filament can automatically generate the [columns](#defining-exporter-columns) for you, based on your model's database columns, using `--generate`:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-exporter Product --generate
```

## Defining exporter columns

To define the columns that can be exported, you need to override the `getColumns()` method on your exporter class, returning an array of `ExportColumn` objects:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn;

public static function getColumns(): array
{
    return [
        ExportColumn::make('name'),
        ExportColumn::make('sku')
            ->label('SKU'),
        ExportColumn::make('price'),
    ];
}
```

### Customizing the label of an export column

The label for each column will be generated automatically from its name, but you can override it by calling the `label()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn;

ExportColumn::make('sku')
    ->label('SKU')
```

### Configuring the default column selection

By default, all columns will be selected when the user is asked which columns they would like to export. You can customize the default selection state for a column with the `enabledByDefault()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn;

ExportColumn::make('description')
    ->enabledByDefault(false)
```

### Disabling column selection

By default, user will be asked which columns they would like to export. You can disable this functionality using `columnMapping(false)`:

```php
use App\Filament\Exports\ProductExporter;

ExportAction::make()
    ->exporter(ProductExporter::class)
    ->columnMapping(false)
```

### Calculated export column state

Sometimes you need to calculate the state of a column, instead of directly reading it from a database column.

By passing a callback function to the `state()` method, you can customize the returned state for that column based on the `$record`:

```php
use App\Models\Order;
use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn;

ExportColumn::make('amount_including_vat')
    ->state(function (Order $record): float {
        return $record->amount * (1 + $record->vat_rate);
    })
```

### Formatting the value of an export column

You may instead pass a custom formatting callback to `formatStateUsing()`, which accepts the `$state` of the cell, and optionally the Eloquent `$record`:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn;

ExportColumn::make('status')
    ->formatStateUsing(fn (string $state): string => __("statuses.{$state}"))
```

If there are [multiple values](#exporting-multiple-values-in-a-cell) in the column, the function will be called for each value.

#### Limiting text length

You may `limit()` the length of the cell's value:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn;

ExportColumn::make('description')
    ->limit(50)
```

#### Limiting word count

You may limit the number of `words()` displayed in the cell:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn;

ExportColumn::make('description')
    ->words(10)
```

#### Adding a prefix or suffix

You may add a `prefix()` or `suffix()` to the cell's value:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn;

ExportColumn::make('domain')
    ->prefix('https://')
    ->suffix('.com')
```

### Exporting multiple values in a cell

By default, if there are multiple values in the column, they will be comma-separated. You may use the `listAsJson()` method to list them as a JSON array instead:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn;

ExportColumn::make('tags')
    ->listAsJson()
```

### Displaying data from relationships

You may use "dot notation" to access columns within relationships. The name of the relationship comes first, followed by a period, followed by the name of the column to display:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn;

ExportColumn::make('author.name')
```

### Counting relationships

If you wish to count the number of related records in a column, you may use the `counts()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn;

ExportColumn::make('users_count')->counts('users')
```

In this example, `users` is the name of the relationship to count from. The name of the column must be `users_count`, as this is the convention that [Laravel uses](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-relationships#counting-related-models) for storing the result.

If you'd like to scope the relationship before calculating, you can pass an array to the method, where the key is the relationship name and the value is the function to scope the Eloquent query with:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

ExportColumn::make('users_count')->counts([
    'users' => fn (Builder $query) => $query->where('is_active', true),
])
```

### Determining relationship existence

If you simply wish to indicate whether related records exist in a column, you may use the `exists()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn;

ExportColumn::make('users_exists')->exists('users')
```

In this example, `users` is the name of the relationship to check for existence. The name of the column must be `users_exists`, as this is the convention that [Laravel uses](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-relationships#other-aggregate-functions) for storing the result.

If you'd like to scope the relationship before calculating, you can pass an array to the method, where the key is the relationship name and the value is the function to scope the Eloquent query with:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

ExportColumn::make('users_exists')->exists([
    'users' => fn (Builder $query) => $query->where('is_active', true),
])
```

### Aggregating relationships

Filament provides several methods for aggregating a relationship field, including `avg()`, `max()`, `min()` and `sum()`. For instance, if you wish to show the average of a field on all related records in a column, you may use the `avg()` method:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn;

ExportColumn::make('users_avg_age')->avg('users', 'age')
```

In this example, `users` is the name of the relationship, while `age` is the field that is being averaged. The name of the column must be `users_avg_age`, as this is the convention that [Laravel uses](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-relationships#other-aggregate-functions) for storing the result.

If you'd like to scope the relationship before calculating, you can pass an array to the method, where the key is the relationship name and the value is the function to scope the Eloquent query with:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

ExportColumn::make('users_avg_age')->avg([
    'users' => fn (Builder $query) => $query->where('is_active', true),
], 'age')
```

## Configuring the export formats

By default, the export action will allow the user to choose between both CSV and XLSX formats. You can use the `ExportFormat` enum to customize this, by passing an array of formats to the `formats()` method on the action:

```php
use App\Filament\Exports\ProductExporter;
use Filament\Actions\Exports\Enums\ExportFormat;

ExportAction::make()
    ->exporter(ProductExporter::class)
    ->formats([
        ExportFormat::Csv,
    ])
    // or
    ->formats([
        ExportFormat::Xlsx,
    ])
    // or
    ->formats([
        ExportFormat::Xlsx,
        ExportFormat::Csv,
    ])
```

Alternatively, you can override the `getFormats()` method on the exporter class, which will set the default formats for all actions that use that exporter:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Exports\Enums\ExportFormat;

public function getFormats(): array
{
    return [
        ExportFormat::Csv,
    ];
}
```

## Modifying the export query

By default, if you are using the `ExportAction` with a table, the action will use the table's currently filtered and sorted query to export the data. If you don't have a table, it will use the model's default query. To modify the query builder before exporting, you can use the `modifyQueryUsing()` method on the action:

```php
use App\Filament\Exports\ProductExporter;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

ExportAction::make()
    ->exporter(ProductExporter::class)
    ->modifyQueryUsing(fn (Builder $query) => $query->where('is_active', true))
```

You may inject the `$options` argument into the function, which is an array of [options](#using-export-options) for that export:

```php
use App\Filament\Exports\ProductExporter;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

ExportAction::make()
    ->exporter(ProductExporter::class)
    ->modifyQueryUsing(fn (Builder $query, array $options) => $query->where('is_active', $options['isActive'] ?? true))
```

Alternatively, you can override the `modifyQuery()` method on the exporter class, which will modify the query for all actions that use that exporter:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\MorphTo;

public static function modifyQuery(Builder $query): Builder
{
    return $query->with([
        'purchasable' => fn (MorphTo $morphTo) => $morphTo->morphWith([
            ProductPurchase::class => ['product'],
            ServicePurchase::class => ['service'],
            Subscription::class => ['plan'],
        ]),
    ]);
}
```

## Configuring the export filesystem

### Customizing the storage disk

By default, exported files will be uploaded to the storage disk defined in the [configuration file](../installation#publishing-configuration), which is `public` by default. You can set the `FILAMENT_FILESYSTEM_DISK` environment variable to change this.

While using the `public` disk a good default for many parts of Filament, using it for exports would result in exported files being stored in a public location. As such, if the default filesystem disk is `public` and a `local` disk exists in your `config/filesystems.php`, Filament will use the `local` disk for exports instead. If you override the disk to be `public` for an `ExportAction` or inside an exporter class, Filament will use that.

In production, you should use a disk such as `s3` with a private access policy, to prevent unauthorized access to the exported files.

If you want to use a different disk for a specific export, you can pass the disk name to the `disk()` method on the action:

```php
ExportAction::make()
    ->exporter(ProductExporter::class)
    ->fileDisk('s3')
```

You may set the disk for all export actions at once in the `boot()` method of a service provider such as `AppServiceProvider`:

```php
use Filament\Actions\ExportAction;

ExportAction::configureUsing(fn (ExportAction $action) => $action->fileDisk('s3'));
```

Alternatively, you can override the `getFileDisk()` method on the exporter class, returning the name of the disk:

```php
public function getFileDisk(): string
{
    return 's3';
}
```

Export files that are created are the developer's responsibility to delete if they wish. Filament does not delete these files in case the exports need to be downloaded again at a later date.

### Configuring the export file names

By default, exported files will have a name generated based on the ID and type of the export. You can also use the `fileName()` method on the action to customize the file name:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Exports\Models\Export;

ExportAction::make()
    ->exporter(ProductExporter::class)
    ->fileName(fn (Export $export): string => "products-{$export->getKey()}.csv")
```

Alternatively, you can override the `getFileName()` method on the exporter class, returning a string:

```php

use Filament\Actions\Exports\Models\Export;

public function getFileName(Export $export): string
{
    return "products-{$export->getKey()}.csv";
}
```

## Using export options

The export action can render extra form components that the user can interact with when exporting a CSV. This can be useful to allow the user to customize the behavior of the exporter. For instance, you might want a user to be able to choose the format of specific columns when exporting. To do this, you can return options form components from the `getOptionsFormComponents()` method on your exporter class:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

public static function getOptionsFormComponents(): array
{
    return [
        TextInput::make('descriptionLimit')
            ->label('Limit the length of the description column content')
            ->integer(),
    ];
}
```

Alternatively, you can pass a set of static options to the exporter through the `options()` method on the action:

```php
ExportAction::make()
    ->exporter(ProductExporter::class)
    ->options([
        'descriptionLimit' => 250,
    ])
```

Now, you can access the data from these options inside the exporter class, by injecting the `$options` argument into any closure function. For example, you might want to use it inside `formatStateUsing()` to [format a column's value](#formatting-the-value-of-an-export-column):

```php
use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn;

ExportColumn::make('description')
    ->formatStateUsing(function (string $state, array $options): string {
        return (string) str($state)->limit($options['descriptionLimit'] ?? 100);
    })
```

Alternatively, since the `$options` argument is passed to all closure functions, you can access it inside `limit()`:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Exports\ExportColumn;

ExportColumn::make('description')
    ->limit(fn (array $options): int => $options['descriptionLimit'] ?? 100)
```

## Using a custom user model

By default, the `exports` table has a `user_id` column. That column is constrained to the `users` table:

```php
$table->foreignId('user_id')->constrained()->cascadeOnDelete();
```

In the `Export` model, the `user()` relationship is defined as a `BelongsTo` relationship to the `App\Models\User` model. If the `App\Models\User` model does not exist, or you want to use a different one, you can bind a new `Authenticatable` model to the container in a service provider's `register()` method:

```php
use App\Models\Admin;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Auth\Authenticatable;

$this->app->bind(Authenticatable::class, Admin::class);
```

If your authenticatable model uses a different table to `users`, you should pass that table name to `constrained()`:

```php
$table->foreignId('user_id')->constrained('admins')->cascadeOnDelete();
```

### Using a polymorphic user relationship

If you want to associate exports with multiple user models, you can use a polymorphic `MorphTo` relationship instead. To do this, you need to replace the `user_id` column in the `exports` table:

```php
$table->morphs('user');
```

Then, in a service provider's `boot()` method, you should call `Export::polymorphicUserRelationship()` to swap the `user()` relationship on the `Export` model to a `MorphTo` relationship:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Exports\Models\Export;

Export::polymorphicUserRelationship();
```

## Limiting the maximum number of rows that can be exported

To prevent server overload, you may wish to limit the maximum number of rows that can be exported from one CSV file. You can do this by calling the `maxRows()` method on the action:

```php
ExportAction::make()
    ->exporter(ProductExporter::class)
    ->maxRows(100000)
```

## Changing the export chunk size

Filament will chunk the CSV, and process each chunk in a different queued job. By default, chunks are 100 rows at a time. You can change this by calling the `chunkSize()` method on the action:

```php
ExportAction::make()
    ->exporter(ProductExporter::class)
    ->chunkSize(250)
```

If you are encountering memory or timeout issues when exporting large CSV files, you may wish to reduce the chunk size.

## Changing the CSV delimiter

The default delimiter for CSVs is the comma (`,`). If you want to export using a different delimiter, you may override the `getCsvDelimiter()` method on the exporter class, returning a new one:

```php
public static function getCsvDelimiter(): string
{
    return ';';
}
```

You can only specify a single character, otherwise an exception will be thrown.

## Styling XLSX cells

If you want to style the cells of the XLSX file, you may override the `getXlsxCellStyle()` method on the exporter class, returning an [OpenSpout `Style` object](https://github.com/openspout/openspout/blob/4.x/docs/documentation.md#styling):

```php
use OpenSpout\Common\Entity\Style\Style;

public function getXlsxCellStyle(): ?Style
{
    return (new Style())
        ->setFontSize(12)
        ->setFontName('Consolas');
}
```

If you want to use a different style for the header cells of the XLSX file only, you may override the `getXlsxHeaderCellStyle()` method on the exporter class, returning an [OpenSpout `Style` object](https://github.com/openspout/openspout/blob/4.x/docs/documentation.md#styling):

```php
use OpenSpout\Common\Entity\Style\CellAlignment;
use OpenSpout\Common\Entity\Style\CellVerticalAlignment;
use OpenSpout\Common\Entity\Style\Color;
use OpenSpout\Common\Entity\Style\Style;

public function getXlsxHeaderCellStyle(): ?Style
{
    return (new Style())
        ->setFontBold()
        ->setFontItalic()
        ->setFontSize(14)
        ->setFontName('Consolas')
        ->setFontColor(Color::rgb(255, 255, 77))
        ->setBackgroundColor(Color::rgb(0, 0, 0))
        ->setCellAlignment(CellAlignment::CENTER)
        ->setCellVerticalAlignment(CellVerticalAlignment::CENTER);
}
```

## Customizing the export job

The default job for processing exports is `Filament\Actions\Exports\Jobs\PrepareCsvExport`. If you want to extend this class and override any of its methods, you may replace the original class in the `register()` method of a service provider:

```php
use App\Jobs\PrepareCsvExport;
use Filament\Actions\Exports\Jobs\PrepareCsvExport as BasePrepareCsvExport;

$this->app->bind(BasePrepareCsvExport::class, PrepareCsvExport::class);
```

Or, you can pass the new job class to the `job()` method on the action, to customize the job for a specific export:

```php
use App\Jobs\PrepareCsvExport;

ExportAction::make()
    ->exporter(ProductExporter::class)
    ->job(PrepareCsvExport::class)
```

### Customizing the export queue and connection

By default, the export system will use the default queue and connection. If you'd like to customize the queue used for jobs of a certain exporter, you may override the `getJobQueue()` method in your exporter class:

```php
public function getJobQueue(): ?string
{
    return 'exports';
}
```

You can also customize the connection used for jobs of a certain exporter, by overriding the `getJobConnection()` method in your exporter class:

```php
public function getJobConnection(): ?string
{
    return 'sqs';
}
```

### Customizing the export job middleware

By default, the export system will only process one job at a time from each export. This is to prevent the server from being overloaded, and other jobs from being delayed by large exports. That functionality is defined in the `WithoutOverlapping` middleware on the exporter class:

```php
public function getJobMiddleware(): array
{
    return [
        (new WithoutOverlapping("export{$this->export->getKey()}"))->expireAfter(600),
    ];
}
```

If you'd like to customize the middleware that is applied to jobs of a certain exporter, you may override this method in your exporter class. You can read more about job middleware in the [Laravel docs](https://laravel.com/docs/queues#job-middleware).

### Customizing the export job retries

By default, the export system will retry a job for 24 hours. This is to allow for temporary issues, such as the database being unavailable, to be resolved. That functionality is defined in the `getJobRetryUntil()` method on the exporter class:

```php
use Carbon\CarbonInterface;

public function getJobRetryUntil(): ?CarbonInterface
{
    return now()->addDay();
}
```

If you'd like to customize the retry time for jobs of a certain exporter, you may override this method in your exporter class. You can read more about job retries in the [Laravel docs](https://laravel.com/docs/queues#time-based-attempts).

### Customizing the export job tags

By default, the export system will tag each job with the ID of the export. This is to allow you to easily find all jobs related to a certain export. That functionality is defined in the `getJobTags()` method on the exporter class:

```php
public function getJobTags(): array
{
    return ["export{$this->export->getKey()}"];
}
```

If you'd like to customize the tags that are applied to jobs of a certain exporter, you may override this method in your exporter class.

### Customizing the export job batch name

By default, the export system doesn't define any name for the job batches. If you'd like to customize the name that is applied to job batches of a certain exporter, you may override the `getJobBatchName()` method in your exporter class:

```php
public function getJobBatchName(): ?string
{
    return 'product-export';
}
```

## Authorization

By default, only the user who started the export may download files that get generated. If you'd like to customize the authorization logic, you may create an `ExportPolicy` class, and [register it in your `AuthServiceProvider`](https://laravel.com/docs/authorization#registering-policies):

```php
use App\Policies\ExportPolicy;
use Filament\Actions\Exports\Models\Export;

protected $policies = [
    Export::class => ExportPolicy::class,
];
```

The `view()` method of the policy will be used to authorize access to the downloads.

Please note that if you define a policy, the existing logic of ensuring only the user who started the export can access it will be removed. You will need to add that logic to your policy if you want to keep it:

```php
use App\Models\User;
use Filament\Actions\Exports\Models\Export;

public function view(User $user, Export $export): bool
{
    return $export->user()->is($user);
}
```

# Documentation for actions. File: 08-advanced.md

title: Advanced actions

## Action utility injection

The vast majority of methods used to configure actions accept functions as parameters instead of hardcoded values:

```php
Action::make('edit')
    ->label('Edit post')
    ->url(fn (): string => route('posts.edit', ['post' => $this->post]))
```

This alone unlocks many customization possibilities.

The package is also able to inject many utilities to use inside these functions, as parameters. All customization methods that accept functions as arguments can inject utilities.

These injected utilities require specific parameter names to be used. Otherwise, Filament doesn't know what to inject.

### Injecting the current modal form data

If you wish to access the current [modal form data](modals#modal-forms), define a `$data` parameter:

```php
function (array $data) {
    // ...
}
```

Be aware that this will be empty if the modal has not been submitted yet.

### Injecting the current arguments

If you wish to access the [current arguments](adding-an-action-to-a-livewire-component#passing-action-arguments) that have been passed to the action, define an `$arguments` parameter:

```php
function (array $arguments) {
    // ...
}
```

### Injecting the current Livewire component instance

If you wish to access the current Livewire component instance that the action belongs to, define a `$livewire` parameter:

```php
use Livewire\Component;

function (Component $livewire) {
    // ...
}
```

### Injecting the current action instance

If you wish to access the current action instance, define a `$action` parameter:

```php
function (Action $action) {
    // ...
}
```

### Injecting multiple utilities

The parameters are injected dynamically using reflection, so you are able to combine multiple parameters in any order:

```php
use Livewire\Component;

function (array $arguments, Component $livewire) {
    // ...
}
```

### Injecting dependencies from Laravel's container

You may inject anything from Laravel's container like normal, alongside utilities:

```php
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

function (Request $request, array $arguments) {
    // ...
}
```

# Documentation for actions. File: 09-testing.md

title: Testing
---

## Overview

All examples in this guide will be written using [Pest](https://pestphp.com). To use Pest's Livewire plugin for testing, you can follow the installation instructions in the Pest documentation on plugins: [Livewire plugin for Pest](https://pestphp.com/docs/plugins#livewire). However, you can easily adapt this to PHPUnit.

Since all actions are mounted to a Livewire component, we're just using Livewire testing helpers everywhere. If you've never tested Livewire components before, please read [this guide](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/testing) from the Livewire docs.

## Getting started

You can call an action by passing its name or class to `callAction()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can send invoices', function () {
    $invoice = Invoice::factory()->create();

    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])
        ->callAction('send');

    expect($invoice->refresh())
        ->isSent()->toBeTrue();
});
```

To pass an array of data into an action, use the `data` parameter:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can send invoices', function () {
    $invoice = Invoice::factory()->create();

    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])
        ->callAction('send', data: [
            'email' => $email = fake()->email(),
        ])
        ->assertHasNoActionErrors();

    expect($invoice->refresh())
        ->isSent()->toBeTrue()
        ->recipient_email->toBe($email);
});
```

If you ever need to only set an action's data without immediately calling it, you can use `setActionData()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can send invoices', function () {
    $invoice = Invoice::factory()->create();

    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])
        ->mountAction('send')
        ->setActionData([
            'email' => $email = fake()->email(),
        ])
});
```

## Execution

To check if an action has been halted, you can use `assertActionHalted()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('stops sending if invoice has no email address', function () {
    $invoice = Invoice::factory(['email' => null])->create();

    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])
        ->callAction('send')
        ->assertActionHalted('send');
});
```

## Modal content

To assert the content of a modal, you should first mount the action (rather than call it which closes the modal). You can then use [Livewire assertions](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/testing#assertions) such as `assertSee()` to assert the modal contains the content that you expect it to:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('confirms the target address before sending', function () {
    $invoice = Invoice::factory()->create();
    $recipientEmail = $invoice->company->primaryContact->email;

    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])
        ->mountAction('send')
        ->assertSee($recipientEmail);
});
```

## Errors

`assertHasNoActionErrors()` is used to assert that no validation errors occurred when submitting the action form.

To check if a validation error has occurred with the data, use `assertHasActionErrors()`, similar to `assertHasErrors()` in Livewire:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can validate invoice recipient email', function () {
    $invoice = Invoice::factory()->create();

    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])
        ->callAction('send', data: [
            'email' => Str::random(),
        ])
        ->assertHasActionErrors(['email' => ['email']]);
});
```

To check if an action is pre-filled with data, you can use the `assertActionDataSet()` method:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can send invoices to the primary contact by default', function () {
    $invoice = Invoice::factory()->create();
    $recipientEmail = $invoice->company->primaryContact->email;

    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])
        ->mountAction('send')
        ->assertActionDataSet([
            'email' => $recipientEmail,
        ])
        ->callMountedAction()
        ->assertHasNoActionErrors();

    expect($invoice->refresh())
        ->isSent()->toBeTrue()
        ->recipient_email->toBe($recipientEmail);
});
```

## Action state

To ensure that an action exists or doesn't, you can use the `assertActionExists()` or  `assertActionDoesNotExist()` method:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can send but not unsend invoices', function () {
    $invoice = Invoice::factory()->create();

    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])
        ->assertActionExists('send')
        ->assertActionDoesNotExist('unsend');
});
```

To ensure an action is hidden or visible for a user, you can use the `assertActionHidden()` or `assertActionVisible()` methods:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can only print invoices', function () {
    $invoice = Invoice::factory()->create();

    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])
        ->assertActionHidden('send')
        ->assertActionVisible('print');
});
```

To ensure an action is enabled or disabled for a user, you can use the `assertActionEnabled()` or `assertActionDisabled()` methods:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can only print a sent invoice', function () {
    $invoice = Invoice::factory()->create();

    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])
        ->assertActionDisabled('send')
        ->assertActionEnabled('print');
});
```

To ensure sets of actions exist in the correct order, you can use `assertActionsExistInOrder()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can have actions in order', function () {
    $invoice = Invoice::factory()->create();

    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])
        ->assertActionsExistInOrder(['send', 'export']);
});
```

To check if an action is hidden to a user, you can use the `assertActionHidden()` method:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can not send invoices', function () {
    $invoice = Invoice::factory()->create();

    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])
        ->assertActionHidden('send');
});
```

## Button appearance

To ensure an action has the correct label, you can use `assertActionHasLabel()` and `assertActionDoesNotHaveLabel()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('send action has correct label', function () {
    $invoice = Invoice::factory()->create();

    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])
        ->assertActionHasLabel('send', 'Email Invoice')
        ->assertActionDoesNotHaveLabel('send', 'Send');
});
```

To ensure an action's button is showing the correct icon, you can use `assertActionHasIcon()` or `assertActionDoesNotHaveIcon()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('when enabled the send button has correct icon', function () {
    $invoice = Invoice::factory()->create();

    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])
        ->assertActionEnabled('send')
        ->assertActionHasIcon('send', 'envelope-open')
        ->assertActionDoesNotHaveIcon('send', 'envelope');
});
```

To ensure that an action's button is displaying the right color, you can use `assertActionHasColor()` or `assertActionDoesNotHaveColor()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('actions display proper colors', function () {
    $invoice = Invoice::factory()->create();

    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])
        ->assertActionHasColor('delete', 'danger')
        ->assertActionDoesNotHaveColor('print', 'danger');
});
```

## URL

To ensure an action has the correct URL, you can use `assertActionHasUrl()`, `assertActionDoesNotHaveUrl()`, `assertActionShouldOpenUrlInNewTab()`, and `assertActionShouldNotOpenUrlInNewTab()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('links to the correct Filament sites', function () {
    $invoice = Invoice::factory()->create();

    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])
        ->assertActionHasUrl('filament', 'https://filamentphp.com/')
        ->assertActionDoesNotHaveUrl('filament', 'https://github.com/filamentphp/filament')
        ->assertActionShouldOpenUrlInNewTab('filament')
        ->assertActionShouldNotOpenUrlInNewTab('github');
});
```

> If you see anything missing from this guide, please do not hesitate to [make a pull request](https://github.com/filamentphp/filament/edit/3.x/packages/actions/docs/10-upgrade-guide.md) to our repository! Any help is appreciated!

## New requirements

- Laravel v9.0+
- Livewire v3.0+

Please upgrade Filament before upgrading to Livewire v3. Instructions on how to upgrade Livewire can be found [here](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/upgrading).

## Upgrading automatically

The easiest way to upgrade your app is to run the automated upgrade script. This script will automatically upgrade your application to the latest version of Filament and make changes to your code, which handles most breaking changes.

```bash
composer require filament/upgrade:"^3.2" -W --dev

vendor/bin/filament-v3
```

Make sure to carefully follow the instructions, and review the changes made by the script. You may need to make some manual changes to your code afterwards, but the script should handle most of the repetitive work for you.

Finally, you must run `php artisan filament:install` to finalize the Filament v3 installation. This command must be run for all new Filament projects.

You can now `composer remove filament/upgrade` as you don't need it anymore.

> Some plugins you're using may not be available in v3 just yet. You could temporarily remove them from your `composer.json` file until they've been upgraded, replace them with a similar plugins that are v3-compatible, wait for the plugins to be upgraded before upgrading your app, or even write PRs to help the authors upgrade them.

## Upgrading manually

After upgrading the dependency via Composer, you should execute `php artisan filament:upgrade` in order to clear any Laravel caches and publish the new frontend assets.

### Low-impact changes

#### Action execution with forms

In v2, if you passed a string to the `action()` function, and used a modal, the method with that name on the class would be run when the modal was submitted:

```php
 Action::make('import_data')
    ->action('importData')
    ->form([
        FileUpload::make('file'),
    ])
```

In v3, passing a string to the `action()` hard-wires it to run that action when the trigger button is clicked, so it does not open a modal.

It is recommended to place your logic in a closure function instead. See the [documentation](overview) for more information.

One easy alternative is using `Closure::fromCallable()`:

```php
Action::make('import_data')
    ->action(Closure::fromCallable([$this, 'importData']))
```

# Documentation for forms. File: 01-installation.md
---
title: Installation
---

**The Form Builder package is pre-installed with the [Panel Builder](/docs/panels).** This guide is for using the Form Builder in a custom TALL Stack application (Tailwind, Alpine, Livewire, Laravel).

## Requirements

Filament requires the following to run:

- PHP 8.1+
- Laravel v10.0+
- Livewire v3.0+
- Tailwind v3.0+ [(Using Tailwind v4?)](#installing-tailwind-css)

## Installation

Require the Form Builder package using Composer:

```bash
composer require filament/forms:"^3.3" -W
```

## New Laravel projects

To quickly get started with Filament in a new Laravel project, run the following commands to install [Livewire](https://livewire.laravel.com), [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com):

> Since these commands will overwrite existing files in your application, only run this in a new Laravel project!

```bash
php artisan filament:install --scaffold --forms

npm install

npm run dev
```

## Existing Laravel projects

Run the following command to install the Form Builder assets:

```bash
php artisan filament:install --forms
```

### Installing Tailwind CSS

> Filament uses Tailwind CSS v3 for styling. If your project uses Tailwind CSS v4, you will unfortunately need to downgrade it to v3 to use Filament. Filament v3 can't support Tailwind CSS v4 since it introduces breaking changes. Filament v4 will support Tailwind CSS v4.

Run the following command to install Tailwind CSS with the Tailwind Forms and Typography plugins:

```bash
npm install tailwindcss@3 @tailwindcss/forms @tailwindcss/typography postcss postcss-nesting autoprefixer --save-dev
```

Create a new `tailwind.config.js` file and add the Filament `preset` *(includes the Filament color scheme and the required Tailwind plugins)*:

```js
import preset from './vendor/filament/support/tailwind.config.preset'

export default {
    presets: [preset],
    content: [
        './app/Filament/**/*.php',
        './resources/views/filament/**/*.blade.php',
        './vendor/filament/**/*.blade.php',
    ],
}
```

### Configuring styles

Add Tailwind's CSS layers to your `resources/css/app.css`:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
@tailwind variants;
```

Create a `postcss.config.js` file in the root of your project and register Tailwind CSS, PostCSS Nesting and Autoprefixer as plugins:

```js
export default {
    plugins: {
        'tailwindcss/nesting': 'postcss-nesting',
        tailwindcss: {},
        autoprefixer: {},
    },
}
```

### Automatically refreshing the browser
You may also want to update your `vite.config.js` file to refresh the page automatically when Livewire components are updated:

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import laravel, { refreshPaths } from 'laravel-vite-plugin'

export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [
        laravel({
            input: ['resources/css/app.css', 'resources/js/app.js'],
            refresh: [
                ...refreshPaths,
                'app/Livewire/**',
            ],
        }),
    ],
})
```

### Compiling assets

Compile your new CSS and Javascript assets using `npm run dev`.

### Configuring your layout

Create a new `resources/views/components/layouts/app.blade.php` layout file for Livewire components:

```blade
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="{{ str_replace('_', '-', app()->getLocale()) }}">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">

        <meta name="application-name" content="{{ config('app.name') }}">
        <meta name="csrf-token" content="{{ csrf_token() }}">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

        <title>{{ config('app.name') }}</title>

        <style>
            [x-cloak] {
                display: none !important;
            }
        </style>

        @filamentStyles
        @vite('resources/css/app.css')
    </head>

    <body class="antialiased">
        {{ $slot }}

        @filamentScripts
        @vite('resources/js/app.js')
    </body>
</html>
```

## Publishing configuration

You can publish the package configuration using the following command (optional):

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=filament-config
```

## Upgrading

> Upgrading from Filament v2? Please review the [upgrade guide](upgrade-guide).

Filament automatically upgrades to the latest non-breaking version when you run `composer update`. After any updates, all Laravel caches need to be cleared, and frontend assets need to be republished. You can do this all at once using the `filament:upgrade` command, which should have been added to your `composer.json` file when you ran `filament:install` the first time:

```json
"post-autoload-dump": [
    // ...
    "@php artisan filament:upgrade"
],
```

Please note that `filament:upgrade` does not actually handle the update process, as Composer does that already. If you're upgrading manually without a `post-autoload-dump` hook, you can run the command yourself:

```bash
composer update

php artisan filament:upgrade
```

# Documentation for forms. File: 02-getting-started.md

title: Getting started

import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"

## Overview

Filament's form package allows you to easily build dynamic forms in your app. You can use it to [add a form to any Livewire component](adding-a-form-to-a-livewire-component). Additionally, it's used within other Filament packages to render forms within [app resources](../panels/resources/getting-started), [action modals](../actions/modals), [table filters](../tables/filters/getting-started), and more. Learning how to build forms is essential to learning how to use these Filament packages.

This guide will walk you through the basics of building forms with Filament's form package. If you're planning to add a new form to your own Livewire component, you should [do that first](adding-a-form-to-a-livewire-component) and then come back. If you're adding a form to an [app resource](../panels/resources/getting-started), or another Filament package, you're ready to go!

## Form schemas

All Filament forms have a "schema". This is an array, which contains [fields](fields/getting-started#available-fields) and [layout components](layout/getting-started#available-layout-components).

Fields are the inputs that your user will fill their data into. For example, HTML's `<input>` or `<select>` elements. Each field has its own PHP class. For example, the [`TextInput`](fields/text-input) class is used to render a text input field, and the [`Select`](fields/select) class is used to render a select field. You can see a full [list of available fields here](fields/getting-started#available-fields).

Layout components are used to group fields together, and to control how they are displayed. For example, you can use a [`Grid`](layout/grid#grid-component) component to display multiple fields side-by-side, or a [`Wizard`](layout/wizard) to separate fields into a multistep form. You can deeply nest layout components within each other to create very complex responsive UIs. You can see a full [list of available layout components here](layout/getting-started#available-layout-components).

### Adding fields to a form schema

Initialise a field or layout component with the `make()` method, and build a schema array with multiple fields:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\RichEditor;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Forms\Form;

public function form(Form $form): Form
{
    return $form
        ->schema([
            TextInput::make('title'),
            TextInput::make('slug'),
            RichEditor::make('content'),
        ]);
}
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/getting-started/fields" alt="Form fields" version="3.x" />

Forms within a panel and other packages usually have 2 columns by default. For custom forms, you can use the `columns()` method to achieve the same effect:

```php
$form
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->columns(2);
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/getting-started/columns" alt="Form fields in 2 columns" version="3.x" />

Now, the `RichEditor` will only consume half of the available width. We can use the `columnSpan()` method to make it span the full width:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\RichEditor;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

[
    TextInput::make('title'),
    TextInput::make('slug'),
    RichEditor::make('content')
        ->columnSpan(2), // or `columnSpan('full')`
]
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/getting-started/column-span" alt="Form fields in 2 columns, but with the rich editor spanning the full width of the form" version="3.x" />

You can learn more about columns and spans in the [layout documentation](layout/grid). You can even make them responsive!

### Adding layout components to a form schema

Let's add a new [`Section`](layout/section) to our form. `Section` is a layout component, and it allows you to add a heading and description to a set of fields. It can also allow fields inside it to collapse, which saves space in long forms.

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\RichEditor;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Section;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

[
    TextInput::make('title'),
    TextInput::make('slug'),
    RichEditor::make('content')
        ->columnSpan(2),
    Section::make('Publishing')
        ->description('Settings for publishing this post.')
        ->schema([
            // ...
        ]),
]
```

In this example, you can see how the `Section` component has its own `schema()` method. You can use this to nest other fields and layout components inside:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\DateTimePicker;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Section;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Section::make('Publishing')
    ->description('Settings for publishing this post.')
    ->schema([
        Select::make('status')
            ->options([
                'draft' => 'Draft',
                'reviewing' => 'Reviewing',
                'published' => 'Published',
            ]),
        DateTimePicker::make('published_at'),
    ])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/getting-started/section" alt="Form with section component" version="3.x" />

This section now contains a [`Select` field](fields/select) and a [`DateTimePicker` field](fields/date-time-picker). You can learn more about those fields and their functionalities on the respective docs pages.

## Validating fields

In Laravel, validation rules are usually defined in arrays like `['required', 'max:255']` or a combined string like `required|max:255`. This is fine if you're exclusively working in the backend with simple form requests. But Filament is also able to give your users frontend validation, so they can fix their mistakes before any backend requests are made.

In Filament, you can add validation rules to your fields by using methods like `required()` and `maxLength()`. This is also advantageous over Laravel's validation syntax, since your IDE can autocomplete these methods:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\DateTimePicker;
use Filament\Forms\Components\RichEditor;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Section;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

[
    TextInput::make('title')
        ->required()
        ->maxLength(255),
    TextInput::make('slug')
        ->required()
        ->maxLength(255),
    RichEditor::make('content')
        ->columnSpan(2)
        ->maxLength(65535),
    Section::make('Publishing')
        ->description('Settings for publishing this post.')
        ->schema([
            Select::make('status')
                ->options([
                    'draft' => 'Draft',
                    'reviewing' => 'Reviewing',
                    'published' => 'Published',
                ])
                ->required(),
            DateTimePicker::make('published_at'),
        ]),
]
```

In this example, some fields are `required()`, and some have a `maxLength()`. We have [methods for most of Laravel's validation rules](validation#available-rules), and you can even add your own [custom rules](validation#custom-rules).

## Dependant fields

Since all Filament forms are built on top of Livewire, form schemas are completely dynamic. There are so many possibilities, but here are a couple of examples of how you can use this to your advantage:

Fields can hide or show based on another field's values. In our form, we can hide the `published_at` timestamp field until the `status` field is set to `published`. This is done by passing a closure to the `hidden()` method, which allows you to dynamically hide or show a field while the form is being used. Closures have access to many useful arguments like `$get`, and you can find a [full list here](advanced#form-component-utility-injection). The field that you depend on (the `status` in this case) needs to be set to `live()`, which tells the form to reload the schema each time it gets changed.

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\DateTimePicker;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;
use Filament\Forms\Get;

[
    Select::make('status')
        ->options([
            'draft' => 'Draft',
            'reviewing' => 'Reviewing',
            'published' => 'Published',
        ])
        ->required()
        ->live(),
    DateTimePicker::make('published_at')
        ->hidden(fn (Get $get) => $get('status') !== 'published'),
]
```

It's not just `hidden()` - all Filament form methods support closures like this. You can use them to change the label, placeholder, or even the options of a field, based on another. You can even use them to add new fields to the form, or remove them. This is a powerful tool that allows you to create complex forms with minimal effort.

Fields can also write data to other fields. For example, we can set the title to automatically generate a slug when the title is changed. This is done by passing a closure to the `afterStateUpdated()` method, which gets run each time the title is changed. This closure has access to the title (`$state`) and a function (`$set`) to set the slug field's state. You can find a [full list of closure arguments here](advanced#form-component-utility-injection). The field that you depend on (the `title` in this case) needs to be set to `live()`, which tells the form to reload and set the slug each time it gets changed.

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Forms\Set;
use Illuminate\Support\Str;

[
    TextInput::make('title')
        ->required()
        ->maxLength(255)
        ->live()
        ->afterStateUpdated(function (Set $set, $state) {
            $set('slug', Str::slug($state));
        }),
    TextInput::make('slug')
        ->required()
        ->maxLength(255),
]
```

title: Getting started
---
import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"

## Overview

Field classes can be found in the `Filament\Form\Components` namespace.

Fields reside within the schema of your form, alongside any [layout components](layout/getting-started).

Fields may be created using the static `make()` method, passing its unique name. The name of the field should correspond to a property on your Livewire component. You may use "dot notation" to bind fields to keys in arrays.

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('name')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/simple" alt="Form field" version="3.x" />

## Available fields

Filament ships with many types of field, suitable for editing different types of data:

- [Text input](text-input)
- [Select](select)
- [Checkbox](checkbox)
- [Toggle](toggle)
- [Checkbox list](checkbox-list)
- [Radio](radio)
- [Date-time picker](date-time-picker)
- [File upload](file-upload)
- [Rich editor](rich-editor)
- [Markdown editor](markdown-editor)
- [Repeater](repeater)
- [Builder](builder)
- [Tags input](tags-input)
- [Textarea](textarea)
- [Key-value](key-value)
- [Color picker](color-picker)
- [Toggle buttons](toggle-buttons)
- [Hidden](hidden)

You may also [create your own custom fields](custom) to edit data however you wish.

## Setting a label

By default, the label of the field will be automatically determined based on its name. To override the field's label, you may use the `label()` method. Customizing the label in this way is useful if you wish to use a [translation string for localization](https://laravel.com/docs/localization#retrieving-translation-strings):

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->label(__('fields.name'))
```

Optionally, you can have the label automatically translated [using Laravel's localization features](https://laravel.com/docs/localization) with the `translateLabel()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->translateLabel() // Equivalent to `label(__('Name'))`
```

## Setting an ID

In the same way as labels, field IDs are also automatically determined based on their names. To override a field ID, use the `id()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->id('name-field')
```

## Setting a default value

Fields may have a default value. This will be filled if the [form's `fill()` method](getting-started#default-data) is called without any arguments. To define a default value, use the `default()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->default('John')
```

Note that these defaults are only used when the form is loaded without existing data. Inside [panel resources](../../panels/resources#resource-forms) this only works on Create Pages, as Edit Pages will always fill the data from the model.

## Adding helper text below the field

Sometimes, you may wish to provide extra information for the user of the form. For this purpose, you may add helper text below the field.

The `helperText()` method is used to add helper text:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->helperText('Your full name here, including any middle names.')
```

This method accepts a plain text string, or an instance of `Illuminate\Support\HtmlString` or `Illuminate\Contracts\Support\Htmlable`. This allows you to render HTML, or even markdown, in the helper text:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Illuminate\Support\HtmlString;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->helperText(new HtmlString('Your <strong>full name</strong> here, including any middle names.'))

TextInput::make('name')
    ->helperText(str('Your **full name** here, including any middle names.')->inlineMarkdown()->toHtmlString())

TextInput::make('name')
    ->helperText(view('name-helper-text'))
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/helper-text" alt="Form field with helper text" version="3.x" />

## Adding a hint next to the label

As well as [helper text](#adding-helper-text-below-the-field) below the field, you may also add a "hint" next to the label of the field. This is useful for displaying additional information about the field, such as a link to a help page.

The `hint()` method is used to add a hint:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('password')
    ->hint('Forgotten your password? Bad luck.')
```

This method accepts a plain text string, or an instance of `Illuminate\Support\HtmlString` or `Illuminate\Contracts\Support\Htmlable`. This allows you to render HTML, or even markdown, in the helper text:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Illuminate\Support\HtmlString;

TextInput::make('password')
    ->hint(new HtmlString('<a href="/forgotten-password">Forgotten your password?</a>'))

TextInput::make('password')
    ->hint(str('[Forgotten your password?](/forgotten-password)')->inlineMarkdown()->toHtmlString())

TextInput::make('password')
    ->hint(view('forgotten-password-hint'))
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/hint" alt="Form field with hint" version="3.x" />

### Changing the text color of the hint

You can change the text color of the hint. By default, it's gray, but you may use `danger`, `info`, `primary`, `success` and `warning`:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\RichEditor;

RichEditor::make('content')
    ->hint('Translatable')
    ->hintColor('primary')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/hint-color" alt="Form field with hint color" version="3.x" />

### Adding an icon aside the hint

Hints may also have an [icon](https://blade-ui-kit.com/blade-icons?set=1#search) rendered next to them:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\RichEditor;

RichEditor::make('content')
    ->hint('Translatable')
    ->hintIcon('heroicon-m-language')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/hint-icon" alt="Form field with hint icon" version="3.x" />

#### Adding a tooltip to a hint icon

Additionally, you can add a tooltip to display when you hover over the hint icon, using the `tooltip` parameter of `hintIcon()`:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->hintIcon('heroicon-m-question-mark-circle', tooltip: 'Need some more information?')
```

## Adding extra HTML attributes

You can pass extra HTML attributes to the field, which will be merged onto the outer DOM element. Pass an array of attributes to the `extraAttributes()` method, where the key is the attribute name and the value is the attribute value:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->extraAttributes(['title' => 'Text input'])
```

Some fields use an underlying `<input>` or `<select>` DOM element, but this is often not the outer element in the field, so the `extraAttributes()` method may not work as you wish. In this case, you may use the `extraInputAttributes()` method, which will merge the attributes onto the `<input>` or `<select>` element:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('categories')
    ->extraInputAttributes(['width' => 200])
```

You can also pass extra HTML attributes to the field wrapper which surrounds the label, entry, and any other text:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('categories')
    ->extraFieldWrapperAttributes(['class' => 'components-locked'])
```

## Disabling a field

You may disable a field to prevent it from being edited by the user:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->disabled()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/disabled" alt="Disabled form field" version="3.x" />

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the field should be disabled or not:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Toggle;

Toggle::make('is_admin')
    ->disabled(! auth()->user()->isAdmin())
```

Disabling a field will prevent it from being saved. If you'd like it to be saved, but still not editable, use the `dehydrated()` method:

```php
Toggle::make('is_admin')
    ->disabled()
    ->dehydrated()
```

> If you choose to dehydrate the field, a skilled user could still edit the field's value by manipulating Livewire's JavaScript.

### Hiding a field

You may hide a field:

 ```php
 use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

 TextInput::make('name')
    ->hidden()
 ```

Optionally, you may pass a boolean value to control if the field should be hidden or not:

 ```php
 use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

 TextInput::make('name')
    ->hidden(! auth()->user()->isAdmin())
 ```

## Autofocusing a field when the form is loaded

Most fields are autofocusable. Typically, you should aim for the first significant field in your form to be autofocused for the best user experience. You can nominate a field to be autofocused using the `autofocus()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->autofocus()
```

## Setting a placeholder

Many fields will also include a placeholder value for when it has no value. This is displayed in the UI but not saved if the field is submitted with no value. You may customize this placeholder using the `placeholder()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->placeholder('John Doe')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/placeholder" alt="Form field with placeholder" version="3.x" />

## Marking a field as required

By default, [required fields](validation#required) will show an asterisk `*` next to their label. You may want to hide the asterisk on forms where all fields are required, or where it makes sense to add a [hint](#adding-a-hint-next-to-the-label) to optional fields instead:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->required() // Adds validation to ensure the field is required
    ->markAsRequired(false) // Removes the asterisk
```

If your field is not `required()`, but you still wish to show an asterisk `*` you can use `markAsRequired()` too:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->markAsRequired()
```

## Global settings

If you wish to change the default behavior of a field globally, then you can call the static `configureUsing()` method inside a service provider's `boot()` method or a middleware. Pass a closure which is able to modify the component. For example, if you wish to make all [checkboxes `inline(false)`](checkbox#positioning-the-label-above), you can do it like so:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Checkbox;

Checkbox::configureUsing(function (Checkbox $checkbox): void {
    $checkbox->inline(false);
});
```

Of course, you are still able to overwrite this behavior on each field individually:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Checkbox;

Checkbox::make('is_admin')
    ->inline()
```

# Documentation for forms. File: 03-fields/02-text-input.md
---
title: Text input
---
import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"

## Overview

The text input allows you to interact with a string:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('name')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/text-input/simple" alt="Text input" version="3.x" />

## Setting the HTML input type

You may set the type of string using a set of methods. Some, such as `email()`, also provide validation:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('text')
    ->email() // or
    ->numeric() // or
    ->integer() // or
    ->password() // or
    ->tel() // or
    ->url()
```

You may instead use the `type()` method to pass another [HTML input type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#input_types):

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('backgroundColor')
    ->type('color')
```

## Setting the HTML input mode

You may set the [`inputmode` attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#inputmode) of the input using the `inputMode()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('text')
    ->numeric()
    ->inputMode('decimal')
```

## Setting the numeric step

You may set the [`step` attribute](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#step) of the input using the `step()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('number')
    ->numeric()
    ->step(100)
```

## Autocompleting text

You may allow the text to be [autocompleted by the browser](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#autocomplete) using the `autocomplete()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('password')
    ->password()
    ->autocomplete('new-password')
```

As a shortcut for `autocomplete="off"`, you may use `autocomplete(false)`:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('password')
    ->password()
    ->autocomplete(false)
```

For more complex autocomplete options, text inputs also support [datalists](#autocompleting-text-with-a-datalist).

### Autocompleting text with a datalist

You may specify [datalist](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/datalist) options for a text input using the `datalist()` method:

```php
TextInput::make('manufacturer')
    ->datalist([
        'BMW',
        'Ford',
        'Mercedes-Benz',
        'Porsche',
        'Toyota',
        'Tesla',
        'Volkswagen',
    ])
```

Datalists provide autocomplete options to users when they use a text input. However, these are purely recommendations, and the user is still able to type any value into the input. If you're looking to strictly limit users to a set of predefined options, check out the [select field](select).

## Autocapitalizing text

You may allow the text to be [autocapitalized by the browser](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#autocapitalize) using the `autocapitalize()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->autocapitalize('words')
```

## Adding affix text aside the field

You may place text before and after the input using the `prefix()` and `suffix()` methods:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('domain')
    ->prefix('https://')
    ->suffix('.com')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/text-input/affix" alt="Text input with affixes" version="3.x" />

### Using icons as affixes

You may place an [icon](https://blade-ui-kit.com/blade-icons?set=1#search) before and after the input using the `prefixIcon()` and `suffixIcon()` methods:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('domain')
    ->url()
    ->suffixIcon('heroicon-m-globe-alt')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/text-input/suffix-icon" alt="Text input with suffix icon" version="3.x" />

#### Setting the affix icon's color

Affix icons are gray by default, but you may set a different color using the `prefixIconColor()` and `suffixIconColor()` methods:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('domain')
    ->url()
    ->suffixIcon('heroicon-m-check-circle')
    ->suffixIconColor('success')
```

## Revealable password inputs

When using `password()`, you can also make the input `revealable()`, so that the user can see a plain text version of the password they're typing by clicking a button:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('password')
    ->password()
    ->revealable()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/text-input/revealable-password" alt="Text input with revealable password" version="3.x" />

## Input masking

Input masking is the practice of defining a format that the input value must conform to.

In Filament, you may use the `mask()` method to configure an [Alpine.js mask](https://alpinejs.dev/plugins/mask#x-mask):

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('birthday')
    ->mask('99/99/9999')
    ->placeholder('MM/DD/YYYY')
```

To use a [dynamic mask](https://alpinejs.dev/plugins/mask#mask-functions), wrap the JavaScript in a `RawJs` object:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Support\RawJs;

TextInput::make('cardNumber')
    ->mask(RawJs::make(<<<'JS'
        $input.startsWith('34') || $input.startsWith('37') ? '9999 999999 99999' : '9999 9999 9999 9999'
    JS))
```

Alpine.js will send the entire masked value to the server, so you may need to strip certain characters from the state before validating the field and saving it. You can do this with the `stripCharacters()` method, passing in a character or an array of characters to remove from the masked value:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Support\RawJs;

TextInput::make('amount')
    ->mask(RawJs::make('$money($input)'))
    ->stripCharacters(',')
    ->numeric()
```

## Making the field read-only

Not to be confused with [disabling the field](getting-started#disabling-a-field), you may make the field "read-only" using the `readOnly()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->readOnly()
```

There are a few differences, compared to [`disabled()`](getting-started#disabling-a-field):

- When using `readOnly()`, the field will still be sent to the server when the form is submitted. It can be mutated with the browser console, or via JavaScript. You can use [`dehydrated(false)`](advanced#preventing-a-field-from-being-dehydrated) to prevent this.
- There are no styling changes, such as less opacity, when using `readOnly()`.
- The field is still focusable when using `readOnly()`.

## Text input validation

As well as all rules listed on the [validation](../validation) page, there are additional rules that are specific to text inputs.

### Length validation

You may limit the length of the input by setting the `minLength()` and `maxLength()` methods. These methods add both frontend and backend validation:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->minLength(2)
    ->maxLength(255)
```

You can also specify the exact length of the input by setting the `length()`. This method adds both frontend and backend validation:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('code')
    ->length(8)
```

### Size validation

You may validate the minimum and maximum value of a numeric input by setting the `minValue()` and `maxValue()` methods:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('number')
    ->numeric()
    ->minValue(1)
    ->maxValue(100)
```

### Phone number validation

When using a `tel()` field, the value will be validated using: `/^[+]*[(]{0,1}[0-9]{1,4}[)]{0,1}[-\s\.\/0-9]*$/`.

If you wish to change that, then you can use the `telRegex()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('phone')
    ->tel()
    ->telRegex('/^[+]*[(]{0,1}[0-9]{1,4}[)]{0,1}[-\s\.\/0-9]*$/')
```

Alternatively, to customize the `telRegex()` across all fields, use a service provider:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::configureUsing(function (TextInput $component): void {
    $component->telRegex('/^[+]*[(]{0,1}[0-9]{1,4}[)]{0,1}[-\s\.\/0-9]*$/');
});
```

    series="rapid-laravel-development"
/>

The select component allows you to select from a list of predefined options:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('status')
    ->options([
        'draft' => 'Draft',
        'reviewing' => 'Reviewing',
        'published' => 'Published',
    ])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/select/simple" alt="Select" version="3.x" />

## Enabling the JavaScript select

By default, Filament uses the native HTML5 select. You may enable a more customizable JavaScript select using the `native(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('status')
    ->options([
        'draft' => 'Draft',
        'reviewing' => 'Reviewing',
        'published' => 'Published',
    ])
    ->native(false)
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/select/javascript" alt="JavaScript select" version="3.x" />

## Searching options

You may enable a search input to allow easier access to many options, using the `searchable()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('author_id')
    ->label('Author')
    ->options(User::all()->pluck('name', 'id'))
    ->searchable()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/select/searchable" alt="Searchable select" version="3.x" />

### Returning custom search results

If you have lots of options and want to populate them based on a database search or other external data source, you can use the `getSearchResultsUsing()` and `getOptionLabelUsing()` methods instead of `options()`.

The `getSearchResultsUsing()` method accepts a callback that returns search results in `$key => $value` format. The current user's search is available as `$search`, and you should use that to filter your results.

The `getOptionLabelUsing()` method accepts a callback that transforms the selected option `$value` into a label. This is used when the form is first loaded when the user has not made a search yet. Otherwise, the label used to display the currently selected option would not be available.

Both `getSearchResultsUsing()` and `getOptionLabelUsing()` must be used on the select if you want to provide custom search results:

```php
Select::make('author_id')
    ->searchable()
    ->getSearchResultsUsing(fn (string $search): array => User::where('name', 'like', "%{$search}%")->limit(50)->pluck('name', 'id')->toArray())
    ->getOptionLabelUsing(fn ($value): ?string => User::find($value)?->name),
```

## Multi-select

The `multiple()` method on the `Select` component allows you to select multiple values from the list of options:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('technologies')
    ->multiple()
    ->options([
        'tailwind' => 'Tailwind CSS',
        'alpine' => 'Alpine.js',
        'laravel' => 'Laravel',
        'livewire' => 'Laravel Livewire',
    ])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/select/multiple" alt="Multi-select" version="3.x" />

These options are returned in JSON format. If you're saving them using Eloquent, you should be sure to add an `array` [cast](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-mutators#array-and-json-casting) to the model property:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class App extends Model
{
    protected $casts = [
        'technologies' => 'array',
    ];

    // ...
}
```

If you're [returning custom search results](#returning-custom-search-results), you should define `getOptionLabelsUsing()` instead of `getOptionLabelUsing()`. `$values` will be passed into the callback instead of `$value`, and you should return a `$key => $value` array of labels and their corresponding values:

```php
Select::make('technologies')
    ->multiple()
    ->searchable()
    ->getSearchResultsUsing(fn (string $search): array => Technology::where('name', 'like', "%{$search}%")->limit(50)->pluck('name', 'id')->toArray())
    ->getOptionLabelsUsing(fn (array $values): array => Technology::whereIn('id', $values)->pluck('name', 'id')->toArray()),
```

## Grouping options

You can group options together under a label, to organize them better. To do this, you can pass an array of groups to `options()` or wherever you would normally pass an array of options. The keys of the array are used as group labels, and the values are arrays of options in that group:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('status')
    ->searchable()
    ->options([
        'In Process' => [
            'draft' => 'Draft',
            'reviewing' => 'Reviewing',
        ],
        'Reviewed' => [
            'published' => 'Published',
            'rejected' => 'Rejected',
        ],
    ])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/select/grouped" alt="Grouped select" version="3.x" />

## Integrating with an Eloquent relationship

> If you're building a form inside your Livewire component, make sure you have set up the [form's model](../adding-a-form-to-a-livewire-component#setting-a-form-model). Otherwise, Filament doesn't know which model to use to retrieve the relationship from.

You may employ the `relationship()` method of the `Select` to configure a `BelongsTo` relationship to automatically retrieve options from. The `titleAttribute` is the name of a column that will be used to generate a label for each option:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('author_id')
    ->relationship(name: 'author', titleAttribute: 'name')
```

The `multiple()` method may be used in combination with `relationship()` to use a `BelongsToMany` relationship. Filament will load the options from the relationship, and save them back to the relationship's pivot table when the form is submitted. If a `name` is not provided, Filament will use the field name as the relationship name:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('technologies')
    ->multiple()
    ->relationship(titleAttribute: 'name')
```

When using `disabled()` with `multiple()` and `relationship()`, ensure that `disabled()` is called before `relationship()`. This ensures that the `dehydrated()` call from within `relationship()` is not overridden by the call from `disabled()`:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('technologies')
    ->multiple()
    ->disabled()
    ->relationship(titleAttribute: 'name')
```

### Searching relationship options across multiple columns

By default, if the select is also searchable, Filament will return search results for the relationship based on the title column of the relationship. If you'd like to search across multiple columns, you can pass an array of columns to the `searchable()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('author_id')
    ->relationship(name: 'author', titleAttribute: 'name')
    ->searchable(['name', 'email'])
```

### Preloading relationship options

If you'd like to populate the searchable options from the database when the page is loaded, instead of when the user searches, you can use the `preload()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('author_id')
    ->relationship(name: 'author', titleAttribute: 'name')
    ->searchable()
    ->preload()
```

### Excluding the current record

When working with recursive relationships, you will likely want to remove the current record from the set of results.

This can be easily be done using the `ignoreRecord` argument:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('parent_id')
    ->relationship(name: 'parent', titleAttribute: 'name', ignoreRecord: true)
```

### Customizing the relationship query

You may customize the database query that retrieves options using the third parameter of the `relationship()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

Select::make('author_id')
    ->relationship(
        name: 'author',
        titleAttribute: 'name',
        modifyQueryUsing: fn (Builder $query) => $query->withTrashed(),
    )
```

If you would like to access the current search query in the `modifyQueryUsing` function, you can inject `$search`.

### Customizing the relationship option labels

If you'd like to customize the label of each option, maybe to be more descriptive, or to concatenate a first and last name, you could use a virtual column in your database migration:

```php
$table->string('full_name')->virtualAs('concat(first_name, \' \', last_name)');
```

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('author_id')
    ->relationship(name: 'author', titleAttribute: 'full_name')
```

Alternatively, you can use the `getOptionLabelFromRecordUsing()` method to transform an option's Eloquent model into a label:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

Select::make('author_id')
    ->relationship(
        name: 'author',
        modifyQueryUsing: fn (Builder $query) => $query->orderBy('first_name')->orderBy('last_name'),
    )
    ->getOptionLabelFromRecordUsing(fn (Model $record) => "{$record->first_name} {$record->last_name}")
    ->searchable(['first_name', 'last_name'])
```

### Saving pivot data to the relationship

If you're using a `multiple()` relationship and your pivot table has additional columns, you can use the `pivotData()` method to specify the data that should be saved in them:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('primaryTechnologies')
    ->relationship(name: 'technologies', titleAttribute: 'name')
    ->multiple()
    ->pivotData([
        'is_primary' => true,
    ])
```

### Creating a new option in a modal

You may define a custom form that can be used to create a new record and attach it to the `BelongsTo` relationship:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('author_id')
    ->relationship(name: 'author', titleAttribute: 'name')
    ->createOptionForm([
        Forms\Components\TextInput::make('name')
            ->required(),
        Forms\Components\TextInput::make('email')
            ->required()
            ->email(),
    ]),
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/select/create-option" alt="Select with create option button" version="3.x" />

The form opens in a modal, where the user can fill it with data. Upon form submission, the new record is selected by the field.

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/select/create-option-modal" alt="Select with create option modal" version="3.x" />

#### Customizing new option creation

You can customize the creation process of the new option defined in the form using the `createOptionUsing()` method, which should return the primary key of the newly created record:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('author_id')
    ->relationship(name: 'author', titleAttribute: 'name')
    ->createOptionForm([
       // ...
    ])
    ->createOptionUsing(function (array $data): int {
        return auth()->user()->team->members()->create($data)->getKey();
    }),
```

### Editing the selected option in a modal

You may define a custom form that can be used to edit the selected record and save it back to the `BelongsTo` relationship:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('author_id')
    ->relationship(name: 'author', titleAttribute: 'name')
    ->editOptionForm([
        Forms\Components\TextInput::make('name')
            ->required(),
        Forms\Components\TextInput::make('email')
            ->required()
            ->email(),
    ]),
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/select/edit-option" alt="Select with edit option button" version="3.x" />

The form opens in a modal, where the user can fill it with data. Upon form submission, the data from the form is saved back to the record.

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/select/edit-option-modal" alt="Select with edit option modal" version="3.x" />

### Handling `MorphTo` relationships

`MorphTo` relationships are special, since they give the user the ability to select records from a range of different models. Because of this, we have a dedicated `MorphToSelect` component which is not actually a select field, rather 2 select fields inside a fieldset. The first select field allows you to select the type, and the second allows you to select the record of that type.

To use the `MorphToSelect`, you must pass `types()` into the component, which tell it how to render options for different types:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\MorphToSelect;

MorphToSelect::make('commentable')
    ->types([
        MorphToSelect\Type::make(Product::class)
            ->titleAttribute('name'),
        MorphToSelect\Type::make(Post::class)
            ->titleAttribute('title'),
    ])
```

#### Customizing the option labels for each morphed type

The `titleAttribute()` is used to extract the titles out of each product or post. If you'd like to customize the label of each option, you can use the `getOptionLabelFromRecordUsing()` method to transform the Eloquent model into a label:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\MorphToSelect;

MorphToSelect::make('commentable')
    ->types([
        MorphToSelect\Type::make(Product::class)
            ->getOptionLabelFromRecordUsing(fn (Product $record): string => "{$record->name} - {$record->slug}"),
        MorphToSelect\Type::make(Post::class)
            ->titleAttribute('title'),
    ])
```

#### Customizing the relationship query for each morphed type

You may customize the database query that retrieves options using the `modifyOptionsQueryUsing()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\MorphToSelect;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

MorphToSelect::make('commentable')
    ->types([
        MorphToSelect\Type::make(Product::class)
            ->titleAttribute('name')
            ->modifyOptionsQueryUsing(fn (Builder $query) => $query->whereBelongsTo($this->team)),
        MorphToSelect\Type::make(Post::class)
            ->titleAttribute('title')
            ->modifyOptionsQueryUsing(fn (Builder $query) => $query->whereBelongsTo($this->team)),
    ])
```

> Many of the same options in the select field are available for `MorphToSelect`, including `searchable()`, `preload()`, `native()`, `allowHtml()`, and `optionsLimit()`.

## Allowing HTML in the option labels

By default, Filament will escape any HTML in the option labels. If you'd like to allow HTML, you can use the `allowHtml()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('technology')
    ->options([
        'tailwind' => '<span class="text-blue-500">Tailwind</span>',
        'alpine' => '<span class="text-green-500">Alpine</span>',
        'laravel' => '<span class="text-red-500">Laravel</span>',
        'livewire' => '<span class="text-pink-500">Livewire</span>',
    ])
    ->searchable()
    ->allowHtml()
```

Be aware that you will need to ensure that the HTML is safe to render, otherwise your application will be vulnerable to XSS attacks.

## Disable placeholder selection

You can prevent the placeholder (null option) from being selected using the `selectablePlaceholder()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('status')
    ->options([
        'draft' => 'Draft',
        'reviewing' => 'Reviewing',
        'published' => 'Published',
    ])
    ->default('draft')
    ->selectablePlaceholder(false)
```

## Disabling specific options

You can disable specific options using the `disableOptionWhen()` method. It accepts a closure, in which you can check if the option with a specific `$value` should be disabled:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('status')
    ->options([
        'draft' => 'Draft',
        'reviewing' => 'Reviewing',
        'published' => 'Published',
    ])
    ->default('draft')
    ->disableOptionWhen(fn (string $value): bool => $value === 'published')
```

If you want to retrieve the options that have not been disabled, e.g. for validation purposes, you can do so using `getEnabledOptions()`:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('status')
    ->options([
        'draft' => 'Draft',
        'reviewing' => 'Reviewing',
        'published' => 'Published',
    ])
    ->default('draft')
    ->disableOptionWhen(fn (string $value): bool => $value === 'published')
    ->in(fn (Select $component): array => array_keys($component->getEnabledOptions()))
```

## Adding affix text aside the field

You may place text before and after the input using the `prefix()` and `suffix()` methods:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('domain')
    ->prefix('https://')
    ->suffix('.com')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/select/affix" alt="Select with affixes" version="3.x" />

### Using icons as affixes

You may place an [icon](https://blade-ui-kit.com/blade-icons?set=1#search) before and after the input using the `prefixIcon()` and `suffixIcon()` methods:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('domain')
    ->suffixIcon('heroicon-m-globe-alt')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/select/suffix-icon" alt="Select with suffix icon" version="3.x" />

#### Setting the affix icon's color

Affix icons are gray by default, but you may set a different color using the `prefixIconColor()` and `suffixIconColor()` methods:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('domain')
    ->suffixIcon('heroicon-m-check-circle')
    ->suffixIconColor('success')
```

## Setting a custom loading message

When you're using a searchable select or multi-select, you may want to display a custom message while the options are loading. You can do this using the `loadingMessage()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('author_id')
    ->relationship(name: 'author', titleAttribute: 'name')
    ->searchable()
    ->loadingMessage('Loading authors...')
```

## Setting a custom no search results message

When you're using a searchable select or multi-select, you may want to display a custom message when no search results are found. You can do this using the `noSearchResultsMessage()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('author_id')
    ->relationship(name: 'author', titleAttribute: 'name')
    ->searchable()
    ->noSearchResultsMessage('No authors found.')
```

## Setting a custom search prompt

When you're using a searchable select or multi-select, you may want to display a custom message when the user has not yet entered a search term. You can do this using the `searchPrompt()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('author_id')
    ->relationship(name: 'author', titleAttribute: 'name')
    ->searchable(['name', 'email'])
    ->searchPrompt('Search authors by their name or email address')
```

## Setting a custom searching message

When you're using a searchable select or multi-select, you may want to display a custom message while the search results are being loaded. You can do this using the `searchingMessage()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('author_id')
    ->relationship(name: 'author', titleAttribute: 'name')
    ->searchable()
    ->searchingMessage('Searching authors...')
```

## Tweaking the search debounce

By default, Filament will wait 1000 milliseconds (1 second) before searching for options when the user types in a searchable select or multi-select. It will also wait 1000 milliseconds between searches, if the user is continuously typing into the search input. You can change this using the `searchDebounce()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('author_id')
    ->relationship(name: 'author', titleAttribute: 'name')
    ->searchable()
    ->searchDebounce(500)
```

Ensure that you are not lowering the debounce too much, as this may cause the select to become slow and unresponsive due to a high number of network requests to retrieve options from server.

## Limiting the number of options

You can limit the number of options that are displayed in a searchable select or multi-select using the `optionsLimit()` method. The default is 50:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('author_id')
    ->relationship(name: 'author', titleAttribute: 'name')
    ->searchable()
    ->optionsLimit(20)
```

Ensure that you are not raising the limit too high, as this may cause the select to become slow and unresponsive due to high in-browser memory usage.

## Select validation

As well as all rules listed on the [validation](../validation) page, there are additional rules that are specific to selects.

### Selected items validation

You can validate the minimum and maximum number of items that you can select in a [multi-select](#multi-select) by setting the `minItems()` and `maxItems()` methods:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('technologies')
    ->multiple()
    ->options([
        'tailwind' => 'Tailwind CSS',
        'alpine' => 'Alpine.js',
        'laravel' => 'Laravel',
        'livewire' => 'Laravel Livewire',
    ])
    ->minItems(1)
    ->maxItems(3)
```

## Customizing the select action objects

This field uses action objects for easy customization of buttons within it. You can customize these buttons by passing a function to an action registration method. The function has access to the `$action` object, which you can use to [customize it](../../actions/trigger-button) or [customize its modal](../../actions/modals). The following methods are available to customize the actions:

- `createOptionAction()`
- `editOptionAction()`
- `manageOptionActions()` (for customizing both the create and edit option actions at once)

Here is an example of how you might customize an action:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('author_id')
    ->relationship(name: 'author', titleAttribute: 'name')
    ->createOptionAction(
        fn (Action $action) => $action->modalWidth('3xl'),
    )
```

# Documentation for forms. File: 03-fields/04-checkbox.md
---
title: Checkbox
---
import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"

## Overview

The checkbox component, similar to a [toggle](toggle), allows you to interact a boolean value.

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Checkbox;

Checkbox::make('is_admin')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/checkbox/simple" alt="Checkbox" version="3.x" />

If you're saving the boolean value using Eloquent, you should be sure to add a `boolean` [cast](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-mutators#attribute-casting) to the model property:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class User extends Model
{
    protected $casts = [
        'is_admin' => 'boolean',
    ];

    // ...
}
```

## Positioning the label above

Checkbox fields have two layout modes, inline and stacked. By default, they are inline.

When the checkbox is inline, its label is adjacent to it:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Checkbox;

Checkbox::make('is_admin')->inline()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/checkbox/inline" alt="Checkbox with its label inline" version="3.x" />

When the checkbox is stacked, its label is above it:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Checkbox;

Checkbox::make('is_admin')->inline(false)
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/checkbox/not-inline" alt="Checkbox with its label above" version="3.x" />

## Checkbox validation

As well as all rules listed on the [validation](../validation) page, there are additional rules that are specific to checkboxes.

### Accepted validation

You may ensure that the checkbox is checked using the `accepted()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Checkbox;

Checkbox::make('terms_of_service')
    ->accepted()
```

### Declined validation

You may ensure that the checkbox is not checked using the `declined()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Checkbox;

Checkbox::make('is_under_18')
    ->declined()
```

# Documentation for forms. File: 03-fields/05-toggle.md
---
title: Toggle
---
import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"

## Overview

The toggle component, similar to a [checkbox](checkbox), allows you to interact a boolean value.

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Toggle;

Toggle::make('is_admin')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/toggle/simple" alt="Toggle" version="3.x" />

If you're saving the boolean value using Eloquent, you should be sure to add a `boolean` [cast](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-mutators#attribute-casting) to the model property:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class User extends Model
{
    protected $casts = [
        'is_admin' => 'boolean',
    ];

    // ...
}
```

## Adding icons to the toggle button

Toggles may also use an [icon](https://blade-ui-kit.com/blade-icons?set=1#search) to represent the "on" and "off" state of the button. To add an icon to the "on" state, use the `onIcon()` method. To add an icon to the "off" state, use the `offIcon()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Toggle;

Toggle::make('is_admin')
    ->onIcon('heroicon-m-bolt')
    ->offIcon('heroicon-m-user')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/toggle/icons" alt="Toggle icons" version="3.x" />

## Customizing the color of the toggle button

You may also customize the color representing the "on" or "off" state of the toggle. These may be either `danger`, `gray`, `info`, `primary`, `success` or `warning`. To add a color to the "on" state, use the `onColor()` method. To add a color to the "off" state, use the `offColor()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Toggle;

Toggle::make('is_admin')
    ->onColor('success')
    ->offColor('danger')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/toggle/off-color" alt="Toggle off color" version="3.x" />

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/toggle/on-color" alt="Toggle on color" version="3.x" />

## Positioning the label above

Toggle fields have two layout modes, inline and stacked. By default, they are inline.

When the toggle is inline, its label is adjacent to it:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Toggle;

Toggle::make('is_admin')
    ->inline()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/toggle/inline" alt="Toggle with its label inline" version="3.x" />

When the toggle is stacked, its label is above it:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Toggle;

Toggle::make('is_admin')
    ->inline(false)
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/toggle/not-inline" alt="Toggle with its label above" version="3.x" />

## Toggle validation

As well as all rules listed on the [validation](../validation) page, there are additional rules that are specific to toggles.

### Accepted validation

You may ensure that the toggle is "on" using the `accepted()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Toggle;

Toggle::make('terms_of_service')
    ->accepted()
```

### Declined validation

You may ensure that the toggle is "off" using the `declined()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Toggle;

Toggle::make('is_under_18')
    ->declined()
```

## Overview

<LaracastsBanner
    title="Checkbox List"
    description="Watch the Rapid Laravel Development with Filament series on Laracasts - it will teach you the basics of adding checkbox list fields to Filament forms."
    url="https://laracasts.com/series/rapid-laravel-development-with-filament/episodes/5"
    series="rapid-laravel-development"
/>


The checkbox list component allows you to select multiple values from a list of predefined options:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\CheckboxList;

CheckboxList::make('technologies')
    ->options([
        'tailwind' => 'Tailwind CSS',
        'alpine' => 'Alpine.js',
        'laravel' => 'Laravel',
        'livewire' => 'Laravel Livewire',
    ])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/checkbox-list/simple" alt="Checkbox list" version="3.x" />

These options are returned in JSON format. If you're saving them using Eloquent, you should be sure to add an `array` [cast](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-mutators#array-and-json-casting) to the model property:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class App extends Model
{
    protected $casts = [
        'technologies' => 'array',
    ];

    // ...
}
```

## Allowing HTML in the option labels

By default, Filament will escape any HTML in the option labels. If you'd like to allow HTML, you can use the `allowHtml()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\CheckboxList;

CheckboxList::make('technology')
    ->options([
        'tailwind' => '<span class="text-blue-500">Tailwind</span>',
        'alpine' => '<span class="text-green-500">Alpine</span>',
        'laravel' => '<span class="text-red-500">Laravel</span>',
        'livewire' => '<span class="text-pink-500">Livewire</span>',
    ])
    ->searchable()
    ->allowHtml()
```

Be aware that you will need to ensure that the HTML is safe to render, otherwise your application will be vulnerable to XSS attacks.

## Setting option descriptions

You can optionally provide descriptions to each option using the `descriptions()` method. This method accepts an array of plain text strings, or instances of `Illuminate\Support\HtmlString` or `Illuminate\Contracts\Support\Htmlable`. This allows you to render HTML, or even markdown, in the descriptions:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\CheckboxList;
use Illuminate\Support\HtmlString;

CheckboxList::make('technologies')
    ->options([
        'tailwind' => 'Tailwind CSS',
        'alpine' => 'Alpine.js',
        'laravel' => 'Laravel',
        'livewire' => 'Laravel Livewire',
    ])
    ->descriptions([
        'tailwind' => 'A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building modern websites without ever leaving your HTML.',
        'alpine' => new HtmlString('A rugged, minimal tool for composing behavior <strong>directly in your markup</strong>.'),
        'laravel' => str('A **web application** framework with expressive, elegant syntax.')->inlineMarkdown()->toHtmlString(),
        'livewire' => 'A full-stack framework for Laravel building dynamic interfaces simple, without leaving the comfort of Laravel.',
    ])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/checkbox-list/option-descriptions" alt="Checkbox list with option descriptions" version="3.x" />

Be sure to use the same `key` in the descriptions array as the `key` in the option array so the right description matches the right option.

## Splitting options into columns

You may split options into columns by using the `columns()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\CheckboxList;

CheckboxList::make('technologies')
    ->options([
        // ...
    ])
    ->columns(2)
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/checkbox-list/columns" alt="Checkbox list with 2 columns" version="3.x" />

This method accepts the same options as the `columns()` method of the [grid](layout/grid). This allows you to responsively customize the number of columns at various breakpoints.

### Setting the grid direction

By default, when you arrange checkboxes into columns, they will be listed in order vertically. If you'd like to list them horizontally, you may use the `gridDirection('row')` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\CheckboxList;

CheckboxList::make('technologies')
    ->options([
        // ...
    ])
    ->columns(2)
    ->gridDirection('row')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/checkbox-list/rows" alt="Checkbox list with 2 rows" version="3.x" />

## Disabling specific options

You can disable specific options using the `disableOptionWhen()` method. It accepts a closure, in which you can check if the option with a specific `$value` should be disabled:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\CheckboxList;

CheckboxList::make('technologies')
    ->options([
        'tailwind' => 'Tailwind CSS',
        'alpine' => 'Alpine.js',
        'laravel' => 'Laravel',
        'livewire' => 'Laravel Livewire',
    ])
    ->disableOptionWhen(fn (string $value): bool => $value === 'livewire')
```

If you want to retrieve the options that have not been disabled, e.g. for validation purposes, you can do so using `getEnabledOptions()`:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\CheckboxList;

CheckboxList::make('technologies')
    ->options([
        'tailwind' => 'Tailwind CSS',
        'alpine' => 'Alpine.js',
        'laravel' => 'Laravel',
        'livewire' => 'Laravel Livewire',
        'heroicons' => 'SVG icons',
    ])
    ->disableOptionWhen(fn (string $value): bool => $value === 'heroicons')
    ->in(fn (CheckboxList $component): array => array_keys($component->getEnabledOptions()))
```

## Searching options

You may enable a search input to allow easier access to many options, using the `searchable()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\CheckboxList;

CheckboxList::make('technologies')
    ->options([
        // ...
    ])
    ->searchable()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/checkbox-list/searchable" alt="Searchable checkbox list" version="3.x" />

## Bulk toggling checkboxes

You may allow users to toggle all checkboxes at once using the `bulkToggleable()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\CheckboxList;

CheckboxList::make('technologies')
    ->options([
        // ...
    ])
    ->bulkToggleable()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/checkbox-list/bulk-toggleable" alt="Bulk toggleable checkbox list" version="3.x" />

## Integrating with an Eloquent relationship

> If you're building a form inside your Livewire component, make sure you have set up the [form's model](../adding-a-form-to-a-livewire-component#setting-a-form-model). Otherwise, Filament doesn't know which model to use to retrieve the relationship from.

You may employ the `relationship()` method of the `CheckboxList` to point to a `BelongsToMany` relationship. Filament will load the options from the relationship, and save them back to the relationship's pivot table when the form is submitted. The `titleAttribute` is the name of a column that will be used to generate a label for each option:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\CheckboxList;

CheckboxList::make('technologies')
    ->relationship(titleAttribute: 'name')
```

When using `disabled()` with `relationship()`, ensure that `disabled()` is called before `relationship()`. This ensures that the `dehydrated()` call from within `relationship()` is not overridden by the call from `disabled()`:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\CheckboxList;

CheckboxList::make('technologies')
    ->disabled()
    ->relationship(titleAttribute: 'name')
```

### Customizing the relationship query

You may customize the database query that retrieves options using the `modifyOptionsQueryUsing` parameter of the `relationship()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\CheckboxList;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

CheckboxList::make('technologies')
    ->relationship(
        titleAttribute: 'name',
        modifyQueryUsing: fn (Builder $query) => $query->withTrashed(),
    )
```

### Customizing the relationship option labels

If you'd like to customize the label of each option, maybe to be more descriptive, or to concatenate a first and last name, you could use a virtual column in your database migration:

```php
$table->string('full_name')->virtualAs('concat(first_name, \' \', last_name)');
```

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\CheckboxList;

CheckboxList::make('authors')
    ->relationship(titleAttribute: 'full_name')
```

Alternatively, you can use the `getOptionLabelFromRecordUsing()` method to transform an option's Eloquent model into a label:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\CheckboxList;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

CheckboxList::make('authors')
    ->relationship(
        modifyQueryUsing: fn (Builder $query) => $query->orderBy('first_name')->orderBy('last_name'),
    )
    ->getOptionLabelFromRecordUsing(fn (Model $record) => "{$record->first_name} {$record->last_name}")
```

### Saving pivot data to the relationship

If your pivot table has additional columns, you can use the `pivotData()` method to specify the data that should be saved in them:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\CheckboxList;

CheckboxList::make('primaryTechnologies')
    ->relationship(name: 'technologies', titleAttribute: 'name')
    ->pivotData([
        'is_primary' => true,
    ])
```

## Setting a custom no search results message

When you're using a searchable checkbox list, you may want to display a custom message when no search results are found. You can do this using the `noSearchResultsMessage()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\CheckboxList;

CheckboxList::make('technologies')
    ->options([
        // ...
    ])
    ->searchable()
    ->noSearchResultsMessage('No technologies found.')
```

## Setting a custom search prompt

When you're using a searchable checkbox list, you may want to tweak the search input's placeholder when the user has not yet entered a search term. You can do this using the `searchPrompt()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\CheckboxList;

CheckboxList::make('technologies')
    ->options([
        // ...
    ])
    ->searchable()
    ->searchPrompt('Search for a technology')
```

## Tweaking the search debounce

By default, Filament will wait 1000 milliseconds (1 second) before searching for options when the user types in a searchable checkbox list. It will also wait 1000 milliseconds between searches if the user is continuously typing into the search input. You can change this using the `searchDebounce()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\CheckboxList;

CheckboxList::make('technologies')
    ->options([
        // ...
    ])
    ->searchable()
    ->searchDebounce(500)
```

## Customizing the checkbox list action objects

This field uses action objects for easy customization of buttons within it. You can customize these buttons by passing a function to an action registration method. The function has access to the `$action` object, which you can use to [customize it](../../actions/trigger-button). The following methods are available to customize the actions:

- `selectAllAction()`
- `deselectAllAction()`

Here is an example of how you might customize an action:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Forms\Components\CheckboxList;

CheckboxList::make('technologies')
    ->options([
        // ...
    ])
    ->selectAllAction(
        fn (Action $action) => $action->label('Select all technologies'),
    )
```

# Documentation for forms. File: 03-fields/07-radio.md
---
title: Radio
---
import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"

## Overview

The radio input provides a radio button group for selecting a single value from a list of predefined options:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Radio;

Radio::make('status')
    ->options([
        'draft' => 'Draft',
        'scheduled' => 'Scheduled',
        'published' => 'Published'
    ])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/radio/simple" alt="Radio" version="3.x" />

## Setting option descriptions

You can optionally provide descriptions to each option using the `descriptions()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Radio;

Radio::make('status')
    ->options([
        'draft' => 'Draft',
        'scheduled' => 'Scheduled',
        'published' => 'Published'
    ])
    ->descriptions([
        'draft' => 'Is not visible.',
        'scheduled' => 'Will be visible.',
        'published' => 'Is visible.'
    ])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/radio/option-descriptions" alt="Radio with option descriptions" version="3.x" />

Be sure to use the same `key` in the descriptions array as the `key` in the option array so the right description matches the right option.

## Boolean options

If you want a simple boolean radio button group, with "Yes" and "No" options, you can use the `boolean()` method:

```php
Radio::make('feedback')
    ->label('Like this post?')
    ->boolean()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/radio/boolean" alt="Boolean radio" version="3.x" />

## Positioning the options inline with the label

You may wish to display the options `inline()` with the label instead of below it:

```php
Radio::make('feedback')
    ->label('Like this post?')
    ->boolean()
    ->inline()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/radio/inline" alt="Inline radio" version="3.x" />

## Positioning the options inline with each other but below the label

You may wish to display the options `inline()` with each other but below the label:

```php
Radio::make('feedback')
    ->label('Like this post?')
    ->boolean()
    ->inline()
    ->inlineLabel(false)
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/radio/inline-under-label" alt="Inline radio under label" version="3.x" />

## Disabling specific options

You can disable specific options using the `disableOptionWhen()` method. It accepts a closure, in which you can check if the option with a specific `$value` should be disabled:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Radio;

Radio::make('status')
    ->options([
        'draft' => 'Draft',
        'scheduled' => 'Scheduled',
        'published' => 'Published',
    ])
    ->disableOptionWhen(fn (string $value): bool => $value === 'published')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/radio/disabled-option" alt="Radio with disabled option" version="3.x" />

If you want to retrieve the options that have not been disabled, e.g. for validation purposes, you can do so using `getEnabledOptions()`:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Radio;

Radio::make('status')
    ->options([
        'draft' => 'Draft',
        'scheduled' => 'Scheduled',
        'published' => 'Published',
    ])
    ->disableOptionWhen(fn (string $value): bool => $value === 'published')
    ->in(fn (Radio $component): array => array_keys($component->getEnabledOptions()))
```

# Documentation for forms. File: 03-fields/08-date-time-picker.md
---
title: Date-time picker
---
import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"

## Overview

The date-time picker provides an interactive interface for selecting a date and/or a time.

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\DatePicker;
use Filament\Forms\Components\DateTimePicker;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TimePicker;

DateTimePicker::make('published_at')
DatePicker::make('date_of_birth')
TimePicker::make('alarm_at')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/date-time-picker/simple" alt="Date time pickers" version="3.x" />

## Customizing the storage format

You may customize the format of the field when it is saved in your database, using the `format()` method. This accepts a string date format, using [PHP date formatting tokens](https://www.php.net/manual/en/datetime.format.php):

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\DatePicker;

DatePicker::make('date_of_birth')
    ->format('d/m/Y')
```

## Disabling the seconds input

When using the time picker, you may disable the seconds input using the `seconds(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\DateTimePicker;

DateTimePicker::make('published_at')
    ->seconds(false)
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/date-time-picker/without-seconds" alt="Date time picker without seconds" version="3.x" />

## Timezones

If you'd like users to be able to manage dates in their own timezone, you can use the `timezone()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\DateTimePicker;

DateTimePicker::make('published_at')
    ->timezone('America/New_York')
```

While dates will still be stored using the app's configured timezone, the date will now load in the new timezone, and it will be converted back when the form is saved.

## Enabling the JavaScript date picker

By default, Filament uses the native HTML5 date picker. You may enable a more customizable JavaScript date picker using the `native(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\DatePicker;

DatePicker::make('date_of_birth')
    ->native(false)
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/date-time-picker/javascript" alt="JavaScript-based date time picker" version="3.x" />

Please be aware that while being accessible, the JavaScript date picker does not support full keyboard input in the same way that the native date picker does. If you require full keyboard input, you should use the native date picker.

### Customizing the display format

You may customize the display format of the field, separately from the format used when it is saved in your database. For this, use the `displayFormat()` method, which also accepts a string date format, using [PHP date formatting tokens](https://www.php.net/manual/en/datetime.format.php):

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\DatePicker;

DatePicker::make('date_of_birth')
    ->native(false)
    ->displayFormat('d/m/Y')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/date-time-picker/display-format" alt="Date time picker with custom display format" version="3.x" />

You may also configure the locale that is used when rendering the display, if you want to use different locale from your app config. For this, you can use the `locale()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\DatePicker;

DatePicker::make('date_of_birth')
    ->native(false)
    ->displayFormat('d F Y')
    ->locale('fr')
```

### Configuring the time input intervals

You may customize the input interval for increasing/decreasing the hours/minutes /seconds using the `hoursStep()` , `minutesStep()` or `secondsStep()` methods:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\DateTimePicker;

DateTimePicker::make('published_at')
    ->native(false)
    ->hoursStep(2)
    ->minutesStep(15)
    ->secondsStep(10)
```

### Configuring the first day of the week

In some countries, the first day of the week is not Monday. To customize the first day of the week in the date picker, use the `firstDayOfWeek()` method on the component. 0 to 7 are accepted values, with Monday as 1 and Sunday as 7 or 0:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\DateTimePicker;

DateTimePicker::make('published_at')
    ->native(false)
    ->firstDayOfWeek(7)
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/date-time-picker/week-starts-on-sunday" alt="Date time picker where the week starts on Sunday" version="3.x" />

There are additionally convenient helper methods to set the first day of the week more semantically:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\DateTimePicker;

DateTimePicker::make('published_at')
    ->native(false)
    ->weekStartsOnMonday()

DateTimePicker::make('published_at')
    ->native(false)
    ->weekStartsOnSunday()
```

### Disabling specific dates

To prevent specific dates from being selected:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\DateTimePicker;

DateTimePicker::make('date')
    ->native(false)
    ->disabledDates(['2000-01-03', '2000-01-15', '2000-01-20'])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/date-time-picker/disabled-dates" alt="Date time picker where dates are disabled" version="3.x" />

### Closing the picker when a date is selected

To close the picker when a date is selected, you can use the `closeOnDateSelection()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\DateTimePicker;

DateTimePicker::make('date')
    ->native(false)
    ->closeOnDateSelection()
```

## Autocompleting dates with a datalist

Unless you're using the [JavaScript date picker](#enabling-the-javascript-date-picker), you may specify [datalist](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/datalist) options for a date picker using the `datalist()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TimePicker;

TimePicker::make('appointment_at')
    ->datalist([
        '09:00',
        '09:30',
        '10:00',
        '10:30',
        '11:00',
        '11:30',
        '12:00',
    ])
```

Datalists provide autocomplete options to users when they use the picker. However, these are purely recommendations, and the user is still able to type any value into the input. If you're looking to strictly limit users to a set of predefined options, check out the [select field](select).

## Adding affix text aside the field

You may place text before and after the input using the `prefix()` and `suffix()` methods:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\DatePicker;

DatePicker::make('date')
    ->prefix('Starts')
    ->suffix('at midnight')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/date-time-picker/affix" alt="Date time picker with affixes" version="3.x" />

### Using icons as affixes

You may place an [icon](https://blade-ui-kit.com/blade-icons?set=1#search) before and after the input using the `prefixIcon()` and `suffixIcon()` methods:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TimePicker;

TimePicker::make('at')
    ->prefixIcon('heroicon-m-play')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/date-time-picker/prefix-icon" alt="Date time picker with prefix icon" version="3.x" />

#### Setting the affix icon's color

Affix icons are gray by default, but you may set a different color using the `prefixIconColor()` and `suffixIconColor()` methods:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TimePicker;

TimePicker::make('at')
    ->prefixIcon('heroicon-m-check-circle')
    ->prefixIconColor('success')
```

## Making the field read-only

Not to be confused with [disabling the field](getting-started#disabling-a-field), you may make the field "read-only" using the `readonly()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\DatePicker;

DatePicker::make('date_of_birth')
    ->readonly()
```

Please note that this setting is only enforced on native date pickers. If you're using the [JavaScript date picker](#enabling-the-javascript-date-picker), you'll need to use [`disabled()`](getting-started#disabling-a-field).

There are a few differences, compared to [`disabled()`](getting-started#disabling-a-field):

- When using `readOnly()`, the field will still be sent to the server when the form is submitted. It can be mutated with the browser console, or via JavaScript. You can use [`dehydrated(false)`](advanced#preventing-a-field-from-being-dehydrated) to prevent this.
- There are no styling changes, such as less opacity, when using `readOnly()`.
- The field is still focusable when using `readOnly()`.

## Date-time picker validation

As well as all rules listed on the [validation](../validation) page, there are additional rules that are specific to date-time pickers.

### Max date / min date validation

You may restrict the minimum and maximum date that can be selected with the picker. The `minDate()` and `maxDate()` methods accept a `DateTime` instance (e.g. `Carbon`), or a string:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\DatePicker;

DatePicker::make('date_of_birth')
    ->native(false)
    ->minDate(now()->subYears(150))
    ->maxDate(now())
```

# Documentation for forms. File: 03-fields/09-file-upload.md
---
title: File upload
---
import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"
import LaracastsBanner from "@components/LaracastsBanner.astro"

## Overview

<LaracastsBanner
    title="File Uploads"
    description="Watch the Rapid Laravel Development with Filament series on Laracasts - it will teach you the basics of adding file upload fields to Filament forms."
    url="https://laracasts.com/series/rapid-laravel-development-with-filament/episodes/8"
    series="rapid-laravel-development"
/>

The file upload field is based on [Filepond](https://pqina.nl/filepond).

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachment')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/file-upload/simple" alt="File upload" version="3.x" />

> Filament also supports [`spatie/laravel-medialibrary`](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-medialibrary). See our [plugin documentation](/plugins/filament-spatie-media-library) for more information.

## Configuring the storage disk and directory

By default, files will be uploaded publicly to your storage disk defined in the [configuration file](../installation#publishing-configuration). You can also set the `FILAMENT_FILESYSTEM_DISK` environment variable to change this.

> To correctly preview images and other files, FilePond requires files to be served from the same domain as the app, or the appropriate CORS headers need to be present. Ensure that the `APP_URL` environment variable is correct, or modify the [filesystem](https://laravel.com/docs/filesystem) driver to set the correct URL. If you're hosting files on a separate domain like S3, ensure that CORS headers are set up.

To change the disk and directory for a specific field, and the visibility of files, use the `disk()`, `directory()` and `visibility()` methods:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachment')
    ->disk('s3')
    ->directory('form-attachments')
    ->visibility('private')
```

> It is the responsibility of the developer to delete these files from the disk if they are removed, as Filament is unaware if they are depended on elsewhere. One way to do this automatically is observing a [model event](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent#events).

## Uploading multiple files

You may also upload multiple files. This stores URLs in JSON:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachments')
    ->multiple()
```

If you're saving the file URLs using Eloquent, you should be sure to add an `array` [cast](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-mutators#array-and-json-casting) to the model property:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Message extends Model
{
    protected $casts = [
        'attachments' => 'array',
    ];

    // ...
}
```

### Controlling the maximum parallel uploads

You can control the maximum number of parallel uploads using the `maxParallelUploads()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachments')
    ->multiple()
    ->maxParallelUploads(1)
```

This will limit the number of parallel uploads to `1`. If unset, we'll use the [default FilePond value](https://pqina.nl/filepond/docs/api/instance/properties/#core-properties) which is `2`.

## Controlling file names

By default, a random file name will be generated for newly-uploaded files. This is to ensure that there are never any conflicts with existing files.

### Security implications of controlling file names

Before using the `preserveFilenames()` or `getUploadedFileNameForStorageUsing()` methods, please be aware of the security implications. If you allow users to upload files with their own file names, there are ways that they can exploit this to upload malicious files. **This applies even if you use the [`acceptedFileTypes()`](#file-type-validation) method** to restrict the types of files that can be uploaded, since it uses Laravel's `mimetypes` rule which does not validate the extension of the file, only its mime type, which could be manipulated.

This is specifically an issue with the `getClientOriginalName()` method on the `TemporaryUploadedFile` object, which the `preserveFilenames()` method uses. By default, Livewire generates a random file name for each file uploaded, and uses the mime type of the file to determine the file extension.

Using these methods **with the `local` or `public` filesystem disks** will make your app vulnerable to remote code execution if the attacker uploads a PHP file with a deceptive mime type. **Using an S3 disk protects you from this specific attack vector**, as S3 will not execute PHP files in the same way that your server might when serving files from local storage.

If you are using the `local` or `public` disk, you should consider using the [`storeFileNamesIn()` method](#storing-original-file-names-independently) to store the original file names in a separate column in your database, and keep the randomly generated file names in the file system. This way, you can still display the original file names to users, while keeping the file system secure.

On top of this security issue, you should also be aware that allowing users to upload files with their own file names can lead to conflicts with existing files, and can make it difficult to manage your storage. Users could upload files with the same name and overwrite the other's content if you do not scope them to a specific directory, so these features should in all cases only be accessible to trusted users.

### Preserving original file names

> Important: Before using this feature, please ensure that you have read the [security implications](#security-implications-of-controlling-file-names).

To preserve the original filenames of the uploaded files, use the `preserveFilenames()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachment')
    ->preserveFilenames()
```

### Generating custom file names

> Important: Before using this feature, please ensure that you have read the [security implications](#security-implications-of-controlling-file-names).

You may completely customize how file names are generated using the `getUploadedFileNameForStorageUsing()` method, and returning a string from the closure based on the `$file` that was uploaded:

```php
use Livewire\Features\SupportFileUploads\TemporaryUploadedFile;

FileUpload::make('attachment')
    ->getUploadedFileNameForStorageUsing(
        fn (TemporaryUploadedFile $file): string => (string) str($file->getClientOriginalName())
            ->prepend('custom-prefix-'),
    )
```

### Storing original file names independently

You can keep the randomly generated file names, while still storing the original file name, using the `storeFileNamesIn()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachments')
    ->multiple()
    ->storeFileNamesIn('attachment_file_names')
```

`attachment_file_names` will now store the original file names of your uploaded files, so you can save them to the database when the form is submitted. If you're uploading `multiple()` files, make sure that you add an `array` [cast](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-mutators#array-and-json-casting) to this Eloquent model property too.

## Avatar mode

You can enable avatar mode for your file upload field using the `avatar()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('avatar')
    ->avatar()
```

This will only allow images to be uploaded, and when they are, it will display them in a compact circle layout that is perfect for avatars.

This feature pairs well with the [circle cropper](#allowing-users-to-crop-images-as-a-circle).

## Image editor

You can enable an image editor for your file upload field using the `imageEditor()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('image')
    ->image()
    ->imageEditor()
```

You can open the editor once you upload an image by clicking the pencil icon. You can also open the editor by clicking the pencil icon on an existing image, which will remove and re-upload it on save.

### Allowing users to crop images to aspect ratios

You can allow users to crop images to a set of specific aspect ratios using the `imageEditorAspectRatios()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('image')
    ->image()
    ->imageEditor()
    ->imageEditorAspectRatios([
        '16:9',
        '4:3',
        '1:1',
    ])
```

You can also allow users to choose no aspect ratio, "free cropping", by passing `null` as an option:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('image')
    ->image()
    ->imageEditor()
    ->imageEditorAspectRatios([
        null,
        '16:9',
        '4:3',
        '1:1',
    ])
```

### Setting the image editor's mode

You can change the mode of the image editor using the `imageEditorMode()` method, which accepts either `1`, `2` or `3`. These options are explained in the [Cropper.js documentation](https://github.com/fengyuanchen/cropperjs#viewmode):

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('image')
    ->image()
    ->imageEditor()
    ->imageEditorMode(2)
```

### Customizing the image editor's empty fill color

By default, the image editor will make the empty space around the image transparent. You can customize this using the `imageEditorEmptyFillColor()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('image')
    ->image()
    ->imageEditor()
    ->imageEditorEmptyFillColor('#000000')
```

### Setting the image editor's viewport size

You can change the size of the image editor's viewport using the `imageEditorViewportWidth()` and `imageEditorViewportHeight()` methods, which generate an aspect ratio to use across device sizes:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('image')
    ->image()
    ->imageEditor()
    ->imageEditorViewportWidth('1920')
    ->imageEditorViewportHeight('1080')
```

### Allowing users to crop images as a circle

You can allow users to crop images as a circle using the `circleCropper()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('image')
    ->image()
    ->avatar()
    ->imageEditor()
    ->circleCropper()
```

This is perfectly accompanied by the [`avatar()` method](#avatar-mode), which renders the images in a compact circle layout.

### Cropping and resizing images without the editor

Filepond allows you to crop and resize images before they are uploaded, without the need for a separate editor. You can customize this behavior using the `imageCropAspectRatio()`, `imageResizeTargetHeight()` and `imageResizeTargetWidth()` methods. `imageResizeMode()` should be set for these methods to have an effect - either [`force`, `cover`, or `contain`](https://pqina.nl/filepond/docs/api/plugins/image-resize).

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('image')
    ->image()
    ->imageResizeMode('cover')
    ->imageCropAspectRatio('16:9')
    ->imageResizeTargetWidth('1920')
    ->imageResizeTargetHeight('1080')
```

## Altering the appearance of the file upload area

You may also alter the general appearance of the Filepond component. Available options for these methods are available on the [Filepond website](https://pqina.nl/filepond/docs/api/instance/properties/#styles).

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachment')
    ->imagePreviewHeight('250')
    ->loadingIndicatorPosition('left')
    ->panelAspectRatio('2:1')
    ->panelLayout('integrated')
    ->removeUploadedFileButtonPosition('right')
    ->uploadButtonPosition('left')
    ->uploadProgressIndicatorPosition('left')
```

### Displaying files in a grid

You can use the [Filepond `grid` layout](https://pqina.nl/filepond/docs/api/style/#grid-layout) by setting the `panelLayout()`:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachments')
    ->multiple()
    ->panelLayout('grid')
```

## Reordering files

You can also allow users to re-order uploaded files using the `reorderable()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachments')
    ->multiple()
    ->reorderable()
```

When using this method, FilePond may add newly-uploaded files to the beginning of the list, instead of the end. To fix this, use the `appendFiles()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachments')
    ->multiple()
    ->reorderable()
    ->appendFiles()
```

## Opening files in a new tab

You can add a button to open each file in a new tab with the `openable()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachments')
    ->multiple()
    ->openable()
```

## Downloading files

If you wish to add a download button to each file instead, you can use the `downloadable()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachments')
    ->multiple()
    ->downloadable()
```

## Previewing files

By default, some file types can be previewed in FilePond. If you wish to disable the preview for all files, you can use the `previewable(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachments')
    ->multiple()
    ->previewable(false)
```

## Moving files instead of copying when the form is submitted

By default, files are initially uploaded to Livewire's temporary storage directory, and then copied to the destination directory when the form is submitted. If you wish to move the files instead, providing that temporary uploads are stored on the same disk as permanent files, you can use the `moveFiles()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachment')
    ->moveFiles()
```

## Preventing files from being stored permanently

If you wish to prevent files from being stored permanently when the form is submitted, you can use the `storeFiles(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachment')
    ->storeFiles(false)
```

When the form is submitted, a temporary file upload object will be returned instead of a permanently stored file path. This is perfect for temporary files like imported CSVs.

Please be aware that images, video and audio files will not show the stored file name in the form's preview, unless you use [`previewable(false)`](#previewing-files). This is due to a limitation with the FilePond preview plugin.

## Orienting images from their EXIF data

By default, FilePond will automatically orient images based on their EXIF data. If you wish to disable this behavior, you can use the `orientImagesFromExif(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachment')
    ->orientImagesFromExif(false)
```

## Hiding the remove file button

It is also possible to hide the remove uploaded file button by using `deletable(false)`:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachment')
    ->deletable(false)
```

## Prevent file information fetching

While the form is loaded, it will automatically detect whether the files exist, what size they are, and what type of files they are. This is all done on the backend. When using remote storage with many files, this can be time-consuming. You can use the `fetchFileInformation(false)` method to disable this feature:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachment')
    ->fetchFileInformation(false)
```

## Customizing the uploading message

You may customize the uploading message that is displayed in the form's submit button using the `uploadingMessage()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachment')
    ->uploadingMessage('Uploading attachment...')
```

## File upload validation

As well as all rules listed on the [validation](../validation) page, there are additional rules that are specific to file uploads.

Since Filament is powered by Livewire and uses its file upload system, you will want to refer to the default Livewire file upload validation rules in the `config/livewire.php` file as well. This also controls the 12MB file size maximum.

### File type validation

You may restrict the types of files that may be uploaded using the `acceptedFileTypes()` method, and passing an array of MIME types.

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('document')
    ->acceptedFileTypes(['application/pdf'])
```

You may also use the `image()` method as shorthand to allow all image MIME types.

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('image')
    ->image()
```

#### Custom MIME type mapping

Some file formats may not be recognized correctly by the browser when uploading files. Filament allows you to manually define MIME types for specific file extensions using the `mimeTypeMap()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('designs')
    ->acceptedFileTypes([
        'x-world/x-3dmf',
        'application/vnd.sketchup.skp',
    ])
    ->mimeTypeMap([
        '3dm' => 'x-world/x-3dmf',
        'skp' => 'application/vnd.sketchup.skp',
    ]);
```

### File size validation

You may also restrict the size of uploaded files in kilobytes:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachment')
    ->minSize(512)
    ->maxSize(1024)
```

#### Uploading large files

If you experience issues when uploading large files, such as HTTP requests failing with a response status of 422 in the browser's console, you may need to tweak your configuration.

In the `php.ini` file for your server, increasing the maximum file size may fix the issue:

```ini
post_max_size = 120M
upload_max_filesize = 120M
```

Livewire also validates file size before uploading. To publish the Livewire config file, run:

```bash
php artisan livewire:publish --config
```

The [max upload size can be adjusted in the `rules` key of `temporary_file_upload`]((https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/uploads#global-validation)). In this instance, KB are used in the rule, and 120MB is 122880KB:

```php
'temporary_file_upload' => [
    // ...
    'rules' => ['required', 'file', 'max:122880'],
    // ...
],
```

### Number of files validation

You may customize the number of files that may be uploaded, using the `minFiles()` and `maxFiles()` methods:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;

FileUpload::make('attachments')
    ->multiple()
    ->minFiles(2)
    ->maxFiles(5)
```

# Documentation for forms. File: 03-fields/10-rich-editor.md
---
title: Rich editor
---
import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"

## Overview

The rich editor allows you to edit and preview HTML content, as well as upload images.

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\RichEditor;

RichEditor::make('content')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/rich-editor/simple" alt="Rich editor" version="3.x" />

## Security

By default, the editor outputs raw HTML, and sends it to the backend. Attackers are able to intercept the value of the component and send a different raw HTML string to the backend. As such, it is important that when outputting the HTML from a rich editor, it is sanitized; otherwise your site may be exposed to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

When Filament outputs raw HTML from the database in components such as `TextColumn` and `TextEntry`, it sanitizes it to remove any dangerous JavaScript. However, if you are outputting the HTML from a rich editor in your own Blade view, this is your responsibility. One option is to use Filament's `sanitizeHtml()` helper to do this, which is the same tool we use to sanitize HTML in the components mentioned above:

```blade
{!! str($record->content)->sanitizeHtml() !!}
```

## Customizing the toolbar buttons

You may set the toolbar buttons for the editor using the `toolbarButtons()` method. The options shown here are the defaults. In addition to these, `'h1'` is also available:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\RichEditor;

RichEditor::make('content')
    ->toolbarButtons([
        'attachFiles',
        'blockquote',
        'bold',
        'bulletList',
        'codeBlock',
        'h2',
        'h3',
        'italic',
        'link',
        'orderedList',
        'redo',
        'strike',
        'underline',
        'undo',
    ])
```

Alternatively, you may disable specific buttons using the `disableToolbarButtons()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\RichEditor;

RichEditor::make('content')
    ->disableToolbarButtons([
        'blockquote',
        'strike',
    ])
```

To disable all toolbar buttons, set an empty array with `toolbarButtons([])` or use `disableAllToolbarButtons()`.

## Uploading images to the editor

You may customize how images are uploaded using configuration methods:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\RichEditor;

RichEditor::make('content')
    ->fileAttachmentsDisk('s3')
    ->fileAttachmentsDirectory('attachments')
    ->fileAttachmentsVisibility('private')
```

## Disabling Grammarly checks

If the user has Grammarly installed and you would like to prevent it from analyzing the contents of the editor, you can use the `disableGrammarly()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\RichEditor;

RichEditor::make('content')
    ->disableGrammarly()
```

# Documentation for forms. File: 03-fields/11-markdown-editor.md
---
title: Markdown editor
---
import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"

## Overview

The markdown editor allows you to edit and preview markdown content, as well as upload images using drag and drop.

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\MarkdownEditor;

MarkdownEditor::make('content')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/markdown-editor/simple" alt="Markdown editor" version="3.x" />

## Security

By default, the editor outputs raw Markdown and HTML, and sends it to the backend. Attackers are able to intercept the value of the component and send a different raw HTML string to the backend. As such, it is important that when outputting the HTML from a Markdown editor, it is sanitized; otherwise your site may be exposed to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

When Filament outputs raw HTML from the database in components such as `TextColumn` and `TextEntry`, it sanitizes it to remove any dangerous JavaScript. However, if you are outputting the HTML from a Markdown editor in your own Blade view, this is your responsibility. One option is to use Filament's `sanitizeHtml()` helper to do this, which is the same tool we use to sanitize HTML in the components mentioned above:

```blade
{!! str($record->content)->markdown()->sanitizeHtml() !!}
```

## Customizing the toolbar buttons

You may set the toolbar buttons for the editor using the `toolbarButtons()` method. The options shown here are the defaults:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\MarkdownEditor;

MarkdownEditor::make('content')
    ->toolbarButtons([
        'attachFiles',
        'blockquote',
        'bold',
        'bulletList',
        'codeBlock',
        'heading',
        'italic',
        'link',
        'orderedList',
        'redo',
        'strike',
        'table',
        'undo',
    ])
```

Alternatively, you may disable specific buttons using the `disableToolbarButtons()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\MarkdownEditor;

MarkdownEditor::make('content')
    ->disableToolbarButtons([
        'blockquote',
        'strike',
    ])
```

To disable all toolbar buttons, set an empty array with `toolbarButtons([])` or use `disableAllToolbarButtons()`.

## Uploading images to the editor

You may customize how images are uploaded using configuration methods:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\MarkdownEditor;

MarkdownEditor::make('content')
    ->fileAttachmentsDisk('s3')
    ->fileAttachmentsDirectory('attachments')
    ->fileAttachmentsVisibility('private')
```

# Documentation for forms. File: 03-fields/12-repeater.md
---
title: Repeater
---
import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"

## Overview

The repeater component allows you to output a JSON array of repeated form components.

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

Repeater::make('members')
    ->schema([
        TextInput::make('name')->required(),
        Select::make('role')
            ->options([
                'member' => 'Member',
                'administrator' => 'Administrator',
                'owner' => 'Owner',
            ])
            ->required(),
    ])
    ->columns(2)
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/repeater/simple" alt="Repeater" version="3.x" />

We recommend that you store repeater data with a `JSON` column in your database. Additionally, if you're using Eloquent, make sure that column has an `array` cast.

As evident in the above example, the component schema can be defined within the `schema()` method of the component:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

Repeater::make('members')
    ->schema([
        TextInput::make('name')->required(),
        // ...
    ])
```

If you wish to define a repeater with multiple schema blocks that can be repeated in any order, please use the [builder](builder).

## Setting empty default items

Repeaters may have a certain number of empty items created by default, using the `defaultItems()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('members')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->defaultItems(3)
```

Note that these default items are only created when the form is loaded without existing data. Inside [panel resources](../../panels/resources#resource-forms) this only works on Create Pages, as Edit Pages will always fill the data from the model.

## Adding items

An action button is displayed below the repeater to allow the user to add a new item.

## Setting the add action button's label

You may set a label to customize the text that should be displayed in the button for adding a repeater item, using the `addActionLabel()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('members')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->addActionLabel('Add member')
```

### Aligning the add action button

By default, the add action is aligned in the center. You may adjust this using the `addActionAlignment()` method, passing an `Alignment` option of `Alignment::Start` or `Alignment::End`:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;
use Filament\Support\Enums\Alignment;

Repeater::make('members')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->addActionAlignment(Alignment::Start)
```

### Preventing the user from adding items

You may prevent the user from adding items to the repeater using the `addable(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('members')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->addable(false)
```

## Deleting items

An action button is displayed on each item to allow the user to delete it.

### Preventing the user from deleting items

You may prevent the user from deleting items from the repeater using the `deletable(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('members')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->deletable(false)
```

## Reordering items

A button is displayed on each item to allow the user to drag and drop to reorder it in the list.

### Preventing the user from reordering items

You may prevent the user from reordering items from the repeater using the `reorderable(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('members')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->reorderable(false)
```

### Reordering items with buttons

You may use the `reorderableWithButtons()` method to enable reordering items with buttons to move the item up and down:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('members')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->reorderableWithButtons()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/repeater/reorderable-with-buttons" alt="Repeater that is reorderable with buttons" version="3.x" />

### Preventing reordering with drag and drop

You may use the `reorderableWithDragAndDrop(false)` method to prevent items from being ordered with drag and drop:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('members')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->reorderableWithDragAndDrop(false)
```

## Collapsing items

The repeater may be `collapsible()` to optionally hide content in long forms:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('qualifications')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->collapsible()
```

You may also collapse all items by default:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('qualifications')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->collapsed()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/repeater/collapsed" alt="Collapsed repeater" version="3.x" />

## Cloning items

You may allow repeater items to be duplicated using the `cloneable()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('qualifications')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->cloneable()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/repeater/cloneable" alt="Cloneable repeater" version="3.x" />

## Integrating with an Eloquent relationship

> If you're building a form inside your Livewire component, make sure you have set up the [form's model](../adding-a-form-to-a-livewire-component#setting-a-form-model). Otherwise, Filament doesn't know which model to use to retrieve the relationship from.

You may employ the `relationship()` method of the `Repeater` to configure a `HasMany` relationship. Filament will load the item data from the relationship, and save it back to the relationship when the form is submitted. If a custom relationship name is not passed to `relationship()`, Filament will use the field name as the relationship name:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('qualifications')
    ->relationship()
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
```

When using `disabled()` with `relationship()`, ensure that `disabled()` is called before `relationship()`. This ensures that the `dehydrated()` call from within `relationship()` is not overridden by the call from `disabled()`:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('qualifications')
    ->disabled()
    ->relationship()
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
```

### Reordering items in a relationship

By default, [reordering](#reordering-items) relationship repeater items is disabled. This is because your related model needs a `sort` column to store the order of related records. To enable reordering, you may use the `orderColumn()` method, passing in a name of the column on your related model to store the order in:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('qualifications')
    ->relationship()
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->orderColumn('sort')
```

If you use something like [`spatie/eloquent-sortable`](https://github.com/spatie/eloquent-sortable) with an order column such as `order_column`, you may pass this in to `orderColumn()`:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('qualifications')
    ->relationship()
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->orderColumn('order_column')
```

### Integrating with a `BelongsToMany` Eloquent relationship

There is a common misconception that using a `BelongsToMany` relationship with a repeater is as simple as using a `HasMany` relationship. This is not the case, as a `BelongsToMany` relationship requires a pivot table to store the relationship data. The repeater saves its data to the related model, not the pivot table. Therefore, if you want to map each repeater item to a row in the pivot table, you must use a `HasMany` relationship with a pivot model to use a repeater with a `BelongsToMany` relationship.

Imagine you have a form to create a new `Order` model. Each order belongs to many `Product` models, and each product belongs to many orders. You have a `order_product` pivot table to store the relationship data. Instead of using the `products` relationship with the repeater, you should create a new relationship called `orderProducts` on the `Order` model, and use that with the repeater:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\HasMany;

public function orderProducts(): HasMany
{
    return $this->hasMany(OrderProduct::class);
}
```

If you don't already have an `OrderProduct` pivot model, you should create that, with inverse relationships to `Order` and `Product`:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\BelongsTo;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\Pivot;

class OrderProduct extends Pivot
{
    public $incrementing = true;

    public function order(): BelongsTo
    {
        return $this->belongsTo(Order::class);
    }

    public function product(): BelongsTo
    {
        return $this->belongsTo(Product::class);
    }
}
```

> Please ensure that your pivot model has a primary key column, like `id`, to allow Filament to keep track of which repeater items have been created, updated and deleted. To make sure that Filament keeps track of the primary key, the pivot model needs to have the `$incrementing` property set to `true`.

Now you can use the `orderProducts` relationship with the repeater, and it will save the data to the `order_product` pivot table:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Repeater::make('orderProducts')
    ->relationship()
    ->schema([
        Select::make('product_id')
            ->relationship('product', 'name')
            ->required(),
        // ...
    ])
```

### Mutating related item data before filling the field

You may mutate the data for a related item before it is filled into the field using the `mutateRelationshipDataBeforeFillUsing()` method. This method accepts a closure that receives the current item's data in a `$data` variable. You must return the modified array of data:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('qualifications')
    ->relationship()
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->mutateRelationshipDataBeforeFillUsing(function (array $data): array {
        $data['user_id'] = auth()->id();

        return $data;
    })
```

### Mutating related item data before creating

You may mutate the data for a new related item before it is created in the database using the `mutateRelationshipDataBeforeCreateUsing()` method. This method accepts a closure that receives the current item's data in a `$data` variable. You can choose to return either the modified array of data, or `null` to prevent the item from being created:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('qualifications')
    ->relationship()
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->mutateRelationshipDataBeforeCreateUsing(function (array $data): array {
        $data['user_id'] = auth()->id();

        return $data;
    })
```

### Mutating related item data before saving

You may mutate the data for an existing related item before it is saved in the database using the `mutateRelationshipDataBeforeSaveUsing()` method. This method accepts a closure that receives the current item's data in a `$data` variable. You can choose to return either the modified array of data, or `null` to prevent the item from being saved:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('qualifications')
    ->relationship()
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->mutateRelationshipDataBeforeSaveUsing(function (array $data): array {
        $data['user_id'] = auth()->id();

        return $data;
    })
```

## Grid layout

You may organize repeater items into columns by using the `grid()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('qualifications')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->grid(2)
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/repeater/grid" alt="Repeater with a 2 column grid of items" version="3.x" />

This method accepts the same options as the `columns()` method of the [grid](../layout/grid). This allows you to responsively customize the number of grid columns at various breakpoints.

## Adding a label to repeater items based on their content

You may add a label for repeater items using the `itemLabel()` method. This method accepts a closure that receives the current item's data in a `$state` variable. You must return a string to be used as the item label:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Repeater::make('members')
    ->schema([
        TextInput::make('name')
            ->required()
            ->live(onBlur: true),
        Select::make('role')
            ->options([
                'member' => 'Member',
                'administrator' => 'Administrator',
                'owner' => 'Owner',
            ])
            ->required(),
    ])
    ->columns(2)
    ->itemLabel(fn (array $state): ?string => $state['name'] ?? null),
```

Any fields that you use from `$state` should be `live()` if you wish to see the item label update live as you use the form.

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/repeater/labelled" alt="Repeater with item labels" version="3.x" />

## Simple repeaters with one field

You can use the `simple()` method to create a repeater with a single field, using a minimal design

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

Repeater::make('invitations')
    ->simple(
        TextInput::make('email')
            ->email()
            ->required(),
    )
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/repeater/simple-one-field" alt="Simple repeater design with only one field" version="3.x" />

Instead of using a nested array to store data, simple repeaters use a flat array of values. This means that the data structure for the above example could look like this:

```php
[
    'invitations' => [
        'dan@filamentphp.com',
        'ryan@filamentphp.com',
    ],
],
```

## Using `$get()` to access parent field values

All form components are able to [use `$get()` and `$set()`](../advanced) to access another field's value. However, you might experience unexpected behavior when using this inside the repeater's schema.

This is because `$get()` and `$set()`, by default, are scoped to the current repeater item. This means that you are able to interact with another field inside that repeater item easily without knowing which repeater item the current form component belongs to.

The consequence of this is that you may be confused when you are unable to interact with a field outside the repeater. We use `../` syntax to solve this problem - `$get('../../parent_field_name')`.

Consider your form has this data structure:

```php
[
    'client_id' => 1,

    'repeater' => [
        'item1' => [
            'service_id' => 2,
        ],
    ],
]
```

You are trying to retrieve the value of `client_id` from inside the repeater item.

`$get()` is relative to the current repeater item, so `$get('client_id')` is looking for `$get('repeater.item1.client_id')`.

You can use `../` to go up a level in the data structure, so `$get('../client_id')` is `$get('repeater.client_id')` and `$get('../../client_id')` is `$get('client_id')`.

The special case of `$get()` with no arguments, or `$get('')` or `$get('./')`, will always return the full data array for the current repeater item.

## Repeater validation

As well as all rules listed on the [validation](../validation) page, there are additional rules that are specific to repeaters.

### Number of items validation

You can validate the minimum and maximum number of items that you can have in a repeater by setting the `minItems()` and `maxItems()` methods:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('members')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->minItems(2)
    ->maxItems(5)
```

### Distinct state validation

In many cases, you will want to ensure some sort of uniqueness between repeater items. A couple of common examples could be:

- Ensuring that only one [checkbox](checkbox) or [toggle](toggle) is activated at once across items in the repeater.
- Ensuring that an option may only be selected once across [select](select), [radio](radio), [checkbox list](checkbox-list), or [toggle buttons](toggle-buttons) fields in a repeater.

You can use the `distinct()` method to validate that the state of a field is unique across all items in the repeater:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Checkbox;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('answers')
    ->schema([
        // ...
        Checkbox::make('is_correct')
            ->distinct(),
    ])
```

The behavior of the `distinct()` validation depends on the data type that the field handles

- If the field returns a boolean, like a [checkbox](checkbox) or [toggle](toggle), the validation will ensure that only one item has a value of `true`. There may be many fields in the repeater that have a value of `false`.
- Otherwise, for fields like a [select](select), [radio](radio), [checkbox list](checkbox-list), or [toggle buttons](toggle-buttons), the validation will ensure that each option may only be selected once across all items in the repeater.

#### Automatically fixing indistinct state

If you'd like to automatically fix indistinct state, you can use the `fixIndistinctState()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Checkbox;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('answers')
    ->schema([
        // ...
        Checkbox::make('is_correct')
            ->fixIndistinctState(),
    ])
```

This method will automatically enable the `distinct()` and `live()` methods on the field.

Depending on the data type that the field handles, the behavior of the `fixIndistinctState()` adapts:

- If the field returns a boolean, like a [checkbox](checkbox) or [toggle](toggle), and one of the fields is enabled, Filament will automatically disable all other enabled fields on behalf of the user.
- Otherwise, for fields like a [select](select), [radio](radio), [checkbox list](checkbox-list), or [toggle buttons](toggle-buttons), when a user selects an option, Filament will automatically deselect all other usages of that option on behalf of the user.

#### Disabling options when they are already selected in another item

If you'd like to disable options in a [select](select), [radio](radio), [checkbox list](checkbox-list), or [toggle buttons](toggle-buttons) when they are already selected in another item, you can use the `disableOptionsWhenSelectedInSiblingRepeaterItems()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Repeater::make('members')
    ->schema([
        Select::make('role')
            ->options([
                // ...
            ])
            ->disableOptionsWhenSelectedInSiblingRepeaterItems(),
    ])
```

This method will automatically enable the `distinct()` and `live()` methods on the field.

In case you want to add another condition to [disable options](../select#disabling-specific-options) with, you can chain `disableOptionWhen()` with the `merge: true` argument:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Repeater::make('members')
    ->schema([
        Select::make('role')
            ->options([
                // ...
            ])
            ->disableOptionsWhenSelectedInSiblingRepeaterItems()
            ->disableOptionWhen(fn (string $value): bool => $value === 'super_admin', merge: true),
    ])
```

## Customizing the repeater item actions

This field uses action objects for easy customization of buttons within it. You can customize these buttons by passing a function to an action registration method. The function has access to the `$action` object, which you can use to [customize it](../../actions/trigger-button). The following methods are available to customize the actions:

- `addAction()`
- `cloneAction()`
- `collapseAction()`
- `collapseAllAction()`
- `deleteAction()`
- `expandAction()`
- `expandAllAction()`
- `moveDownAction()`
- `moveUpAction()`
- `reorderAction()`

Here is an example of how you might customize an action:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('members')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->collapseAllAction(
        fn (Action $action) => $action->label('Collapse all members'),
    )
```

### Confirming repeater actions with a modal

You can confirm actions with a modal by using the `requiresConfirmation()` method on the action object. You may use any [modal customization method](../../actions/modals) to change its content and behavior:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;

Repeater::make('members')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->deleteAction(
        fn (Action $action) => $action->requiresConfirmation(),
    )
```

> The `collapseAction()`, `collapseAllAction()`, `expandAction()`, `expandAllAction()` and `reorderAction()` methods do not support confirmation modals, as clicking their buttons does not make the network request that is required to show the modal.

### Adding extra item actions to a repeater

You may add new [action buttons](../actions) to the header of each repeater item by passing `Action` objects into `extraItemActions()`:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Mail;

Repeater::make('members')
    ->schema([
        TextInput::make('email')
            ->label('Email address')
            ->email(),
        // ...
    ])
    ->extraItemActions([
        Action::make('sendEmail')
            ->icon('heroicon-m-envelope')
            ->action(function (array $arguments, Repeater $component): void {
                $itemData = $component->getItemState($arguments['item']);

                Mail::to($itemData['email'])
                    ->send(
                        // ...
                    );
            }),
    ])
```

In this example, `$arguments['item']` gives you the ID of the current repeater item. You can validate the data in that repeater item using the `getItemState()` method on the repeater component. This method returns the validated data for the item. If the item is not valid, it will cancel the action and show an error message for that item in the form.

If you want to get the raw data from the current item without validating it, you can use `$component->getRawItemState($arguments['item'])` instead.

If you want to manipulate the raw data for the entire repeater, for example, to add, remove or modify items, you can use `$component->getState()` to get the data, and `$component->state($state)` to set it again:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Str;

// Get the raw data for the entire repeater
$state = $component->getState();

// Add an item, with a random UUID as the key
$state[Str::uuid()] = [
    'email' => auth()->user()->email,
];

// Set the new data for the repeater
$component->state($state);
```

## Testing repeaters

Internally, repeaters generate UUIDs for items to keep track of them in the Livewire HTML easier. This means that when you are testing a form with a repeater, you need to ensure that the UUIDs are consistent between the form and the test. This can be tricky, and if you don't do it correctly, your tests can fail as the tests are expecting a UUID, not a numeric key.

However, since Livewire doesn't need to keep track of the UUIDs in a test, you can disable the UUID generation and replace them with numeric keys, using the `Repeater::fake()` method at the start of your test:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

$undoRepeaterFake = Repeater::fake();

livewire(EditPost::class, ['record' => $post])
    ->assertFormSet([
        'quotes' => [
            [
                'content' => 'First quote',
            ],
            [
                'content' => 'Second quote',
            ],
        ],
        // ...
    ]);

$undoRepeaterFake();
```

You may also find it useful to test the number of items in a repeater by passing a function to the `assertFormSet()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

$undoRepeaterFake = Repeater::fake();

livewire(EditPost::class, ['record' => $post])
    ->assertFormSet(function (array $state) {
        expect($state['quotes'])
            ->toHaveCount(2);
    });

$undoRepeaterFake();
```

### Testing repeater actions

In order to test that repeater actions are working as expected, you can utilize the `callFormComponentAction()` method to call your repeater actions and then [perform additional assertions](../testing#actions).

To interact with an action on a particular repeater item, you need to pass in the `item` argument with the key of that repeater item. If your repeater is reading from a relationship, you should prefix the ID (key) of the related record with `record-` to form the key of the repeater item:  

```php
use App\Models\Quote;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Repeater;
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

$quote = Quote::first();

livewire(EditPost::class, ['record' => $post])
    ->callFormComponentAction('quotes', 'sendQuote', arguments: [
        'item' => "record-{$quote->getKey()}",
    ])
    ->assertNotified('Quote sent!');
```

## Overview

Similar to a [repeater](repeater), the builder component allows you to output a JSON array of repeated form components. Unlike the repeater, which only defines one form schema to repeat, the builder allows you to define different schema "blocks", which you can repeat in any order. This makes it useful for building more advanced array structures.

The primary use of the builder component is to build web page content using predefined blocks. This could be content for a marketing website, or maybe even fields in an online form. The example below defines multiple blocks for different elements in the page content. On the frontend of your website, you could loop through each block in the JSON and format it how you wish.

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder;
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Textarea;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

Builder::make('content')
    ->blocks([
        Builder\Block::make('heading')
            ->schema([
                TextInput::make('content')
                    ->label('Heading')
                    ->required(),
                Select::make('level')
                    ->options([
                        'h1' => 'Heading 1',
                        'h2' => 'Heading 2',
                        'h3' => 'Heading 3',
                        'h4' => 'Heading 4',
                        'h5' => 'Heading 5',
                        'h6' => 'Heading 6',
                    ])
                    ->required(),
            ])
            ->columns(2),
        Builder\Block::make('paragraph')
            ->schema([
                Textarea::make('content')
                    ->label('Paragraph')
                    ->required(),
            ]),
        Builder\Block::make('image')
            ->schema([
                FileUpload::make('url')
                    ->label('Image')
                    ->image()
                    ->required(),
                TextInput::make('alt')
                    ->label('Alt text')
                    ->required(),
            ]),
    ])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/builder/simple" alt="Builder" version="3.x" />

We recommend that you store builder data with a `JSON` column in your database. Additionally, if you're using Eloquent, make sure that column has an `array` cast.

As evident in the above example, blocks can be defined within the `blocks()` method of the component. Blocks are `Builder\Block` objects, and require a unique name, and a component schema:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

Builder::make('content')
    ->blocks([
        Builder\Block::make('heading')
            ->schema([
                TextInput::make('content')->required(),
                // ...
            ]),
        // ...
    ])
```

## Setting a block's label

By default, the label of the block will be automatically determined based on its name. To override the block's label, you may use the `label()` method. Customizing the label in this way is useful if you wish to use a [translation string for localization](https://laravel.com/docs/localization#retrieving-translation-strings):

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder;

Builder\Block::make('heading')
    ->label(__('blocks.heading'))
```

### Labelling builder items based on their content

You may add a label for a builder item using the same `label()` method. This method accepts a closure that receives the item's data in a `$state` variable. If `$state` is null, you should return the block label that should be displayed in the block picker. Otherwise, you should return a string to be used as the item label:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

Builder\Block::make('heading')
    ->schema([
        TextInput::make('content')
            ->live(onBlur: true)
            ->required(),
        // ...
    ])
    ->label(function (?array $state): string {
        if ($state === null) {
            return 'Heading';
        }

        return $state['content'] ?? 'Untitled heading';
    })
```

Any fields that you use from `$state` should be `live()` if you wish to see the item label update live as you use the form.

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/builder/labelled" alt="Builder with labelled blocks based on the content" version="3.x" />

### Numbering builder items

By default, items in the builder have a number next to their label. You may disable this using the `blockNumbers(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder;

Builder::make('content')
    ->blocks([
        // ...
    ])
    ->blockNumbers(false)
```

## Setting a block's icon

Blocks may also have an [icon](https://blade-ui-kit.com/blade-icons?set=1#search), which is displayed next to the label. You can add an icon by passing its name to the `icon()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder;

Builder\Block::make('paragraph')
    ->icon('heroicon-m-bars-3-bottom-left')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/builder/icons" alt="Builder with block icons in the dropdown" version="3.x" />

### Adding icons to the header of blocks

By default, blocks in the builder don't have an icon next to the header label, just in the dropdown to add new blocks. You may enable this using the `blockIcons()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder;

Builder::make('content')
    ->blocks([
        // ...
    ])
    ->blockIcons()
```

## Adding items

An action button is displayed below the builder to allow the user to add a new item.

## Setting the add action button's label

You may set a label to customize the text that should be displayed in the button for adding a builder item, using the `addActionLabel()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder;

Builder::make('content')
    ->blocks([
        // ...
    ])
    ->addActionLabel('Add a new block')
```

### Aligning the add action button

By default, the add action is aligned in the center. You may adjust this using the `addActionAlignment()` method, passing an `Alignment` option of `Alignment::Start` or `Alignment::End`:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder;
use Filament\Support\Enums\Alignment;

Builder::make('content')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->addActionAlignment(Alignment::Start)
```

### Preventing the user from adding items

You may prevent the user from adding items to the builder using the `addable(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder;

Builder::make('content')
    ->blocks([
        // ...
    ])
    ->addable(false)
```

## Deleting items

An action button is displayed on each item to allow the user to delete it.

### Preventing the user from deleting items

You may prevent the user from deleting items from the builder using the `deletable(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder;

Builder::make('content')
    ->blocks([
        // ...
    ])
    ->deletable(false)
```

## Reordering items

A button is displayed on each item to allow the user to drag and drop to reorder it in the list.

### Preventing the user from reordering items

You may prevent the user from reordering items from the builder using the `reorderable(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder;

Builder::make('content')
    ->blocks([
        // ...
    ])
    ->reorderable(false)
```

### Reordering items with buttons

You may use the `reorderableWithButtons()` method to enable reordering items with buttons to move the item up and down:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder;

Builder::make('content')
    ->blocks([
        // ...
    ])
    ->reorderableWithButtons()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/builder/reorderable-with-buttons" alt="Builder that is reorderable with buttons" version="3.x" />

### Preventing reordering with drag and drop

You may use the `reorderableWithDragAndDrop(false)` method to prevent items from being ordered with drag and drop:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder;

Builder::make('content')
    ->blocks([
        // ...
    ])
    ->reorderableWithDragAndDrop(false)
```

## Collapsing items

The builder may be `collapsible()` to optionally hide content in long forms:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder;

Builder::make('content')
    ->blocks([
        // ...
    ])
    ->collapsible()
```

You may also collapse all items by default:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder;

Builder::make('content')
    ->blocks([
        // ...
    ])
    ->collapsed()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/builder/collapsed" alt="Collapsed builder" version="3.x" />

## Cloning items

You may allow builder items to be duplicated using the `cloneable()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder;

Builder::make('content')
    ->blocks([
        // ...
    ])
    ->cloneable()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/builder/cloneable" alt="Builder repeater" version="3.x" />

## Customizing the block picker

### Changing the number of columns in the block picker

The block picker has only 1 column. You may customize it by passing a number of columns to `blockPickerColumns()`:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder;

Builder::make()
    ->blockPickerColumns(2)
    ->blocks([
        // ...
    ])
```

This method can be used in a couple of different ways:

- You can pass an integer like `blockPickerColumns(2)`. This integer is the number of columns used on the `lg` breakpoint and higher. All smaller devices will have just 1 column.
- You can pass an array, where the key is the breakpoint and the value is the number of columns. For example, `blockPickerColumns(['md' => 2, 'xl' => 4])` will create a 2 column layout on medium devices, and a 4 column layout on extra large devices. The default breakpoint for smaller devices uses 1 column, unless you use a `default` array key.

Breakpoints (`sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, `2xl`) are defined by Tailwind, and can be found in the [Tailwind documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design#overview).

### Increasing the width of the block picker

When you [increase the number of columns](#changing-the-number-of-columns-in-the-block-picker), the width of the dropdown should increase incrementally to handle the additional columns. If you'd like more control, you can manually set a maximum width for the dropdown using the `blockPickerWidth()` method. Options correspond to [Tailwind's max-width scale](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/max-width). The options are `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, `2xl`, `3xl`, `4xl`, `5xl`, `6xl`, `7xl`:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder;

Builder::make()
    ->blockPickerColumns(3)
    ->blockPickerWidth('2xl')
    ->blocks([
        // ...
    ])
```

## Limiting the number of times a block can be used

By default, each block can be used in the builder an unlimited number of times. You may limit this using the `maxItems()` method on a block:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder;

Builder\Block::make('heading')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->maxItems(1)
```

## Builder validation

As well as all rules listed on the [validation](../validation) page, there are additional rules that are specific to builders.

### Number of items validation

You can validate the minimum and maximum number of items that you can have in a builder by setting the `minItems()` and `maxItems()` methods:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder;

Builder::make('content')
    ->blocks([
        // ...
    ])
    ->minItems(1)
    ->maxItems(5)
```

## Using `$get()` to access parent field values

All form components are able to [use `$get()` and `$set()`](../advanced) to access another field's value. However, you might experience unexpected behavior when using this inside the builder's schema.

This is because `$get()` and `$set()`, by default, are scoped to the current builder item. This means that you are able to interact with another field inside that builder item easily without knowing which builder item the current form component belongs to.

The consequence of this is that you may be confused when you are unable to interact with a field outside the builder. We use `../` syntax to solve this problem - `$get('../../parent_field_name')`.

Consider your form has this data structure:

```php
[
    'client_id' => 1,

    'builder' => [
        'item1' => [
            'service_id' => 2,
        ],
    ],
]
```

You are trying to retrieve the value of `client_id` from inside the builder item.

`$get()` is relative to the current builder item, so `$get('client_id')` is looking for `$get('builder.item1.client_id')`.

You can use `../` to go up a level in the data structure, so `$get('../client_id')` is `$get('builder.client_id')` and `$get('../../client_id')` is `$get('client_id')`.

The special case of `$get()` with no arguments, or `$get('')` or `$get('./')`, will always return the full data array for the current builder item.

## Customizing the builder item actions

This field uses action objects for easy customization of buttons within it. You can customize these buttons by passing a function to an action registration method. The function has access to the `$action` object, which you can use to [customize it](../../actions/trigger-button). The following methods are available to customize the actions:

- `addAction()`
- `addBetweenAction()`
- `cloneAction()`
- `collapseAction()`
- `collapseAllAction()`
- `deleteAction()`
- `expandAction()`
- `expandAllAction()`
- `moveDownAction()`
- `moveUpAction()`
- `reorderAction()`

Here is an example of how you might customize an action:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder;

Builder::make('content')
    ->blocks([
        // ...
    ])
    ->collapseAllAction(
        fn (Action $action) => $action->label('Collapse all content'),
    )
```

### Confirming builder actions with a modal

You can confirm actions with a modal by using the `requiresConfirmation()` method on the action object. You may use any [modal customization method](../../actions/modals) to change its content and behavior:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder;

Builder::make('content')
    ->blocks([
        // ...
    ])
    ->deleteAction(
        fn (Action $action) => $action->requiresConfirmation(),
    )
```

> The `addAction()`, `addBetweenAction()`, `collapseAction()`, `collapseAllAction()`, `expandAction()`, `expandAllAction()` and `reorderAction()` methods do not support confirmation modals, as clicking their buttons does not make the network request that is required to show the modal.

### Adding extra item actions to a builder

You may add new [action buttons](../actions) to the header of each builder item by passing `Action` objects into `extraItemActions()`:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Mail;

Builder::make('content')
    ->blocks([
        Builder\Block::make('contactDetails')
            ->schema([
                TextInput::make('email')
                    ->label('Email address')
                    ->email()
                    ->required(),
                // ...
            ]),
        // ...
    ])
    ->extraItemActions([
        Action::make('sendEmail')
            ->icon('heroicon-m-square-2-stack')
            ->action(function (array $arguments, Builder $component): void {
                $itemData = $component->getItemState($arguments['item']);
                
                Mail::to($itemData['email'])
                    ->send(
                        // ...
                    );
            }),
    ])
```

In this example, `$arguments['item']` gives you the ID of the current builder item. You can validate the data in that builder item using the `getItemState()` method on the builder component. This method returns the validated data for the item. If the item is not valid, it will cancel the action and show an error message for that item in the form.

If you want to get the raw data from the current item without validating it, you can use `$component->getRawItemState($arguments['item'])` instead.

If you want to manipulate the raw data for the entire builder, for example, to add, remove or modify items, you can use `$component->getState()` to get the data, and `$component->state($state)` to set it again:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Str;

// Get the raw data for the entire builder
$state = $component->getState();

// Add an item, with a random UUID as the key
$state[Str::uuid()] = [
    'type' => 'contactDetails',
    'data' => [
        'email' => auth()->user()->email,
    ],
];

// Set the new data for the builder
$component->state($state);
```

## Previewing blocks

If you prefer to render read-only previews in the builder instead of the blocks' forms, you can use the `blockPreviews()` method. This will render each block's `preview()` instead of the form. Block data will be passed to the preview Blade view in a variable with the same name:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder\Block;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

Builder::make('content')
    ->blockPreviews()
    ->blocks([
        Block::make('heading')
            ->schema([
                TextInput::make('text')
                    ->placeholder('Default heading'),
            ])
            ->preview('filament.content.block-previews.heading'),
    ])
```

In `/resources/views/filament/content/block-previews/heading.blade.php`, you can access the block data like so:

```blade
<h1>
    {{ $text ?? 'Default heading' }}
</h1>
```

### Interactive block previews

By default, preview content is not interactive, and clicking it will open the Edit modal for that block to manage its settings. If you have links and buttons that you'd like to remain interactive in the block previews, you can use the `areInteractive: true` argument of the `blockPreviews()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder;

Builder::make('content')
    ->blockPreviews(areInteractive: true)
    ->blocks([
        //
    ])
```

## Testing builders

Internally, builders generate UUIDs for items to keep track of them in the Livewire HTML easier. This means that when you are testing a form with a builder, you need to ensure that the UUIDs are consistent between the form and the test. This can be tricky, and if you don't do it correctly, your tests can fail as the tests are expecting a UUID, not a numeric key.

However, since Livewire doesn't need to keep track of the UUIDs in a test, you can disable the UUID generation and replace them with numeric keys, using the `Builder::fake()` method at the start of your test:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder;
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

$undoBuilderFake = Builder::fake();

livewire(EditPost::class, ['record' => $post])
    ->assertFormSet([
        'content' => [
            [
                'type' => 'heading',
                'data' => [
                    'content' => 'Hello, world!',
                    'level' => 'h1',
                ],
            ],
            [
                'type' => 'paragraph',
                'data' => [
                    'content' => 'This is a test post.',
                ],
            ],
        ],
        // ...
    ]);

$undoBuilderFake();
```

You may also find it useful to access test the number of items in a repeater by passing a function to the `assertFormSet()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Builder;
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

$undoBuilderFake = Builder::fake();

livewire(EditPost::class, ['record' => $post])
    ->assertFormSet(function (array $state) {
        expect($state['content'])
            ->toHaveCount(2);
    });

$undoBuilderFake();
```

# Documentation for forms. File: 03-fields/14-tags-input.md
---
title: Tags input
---
import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"

## Overview

The tags input component allows you to interact with a list of tags.

By default, tags are stored in JSON:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TagsInput;

TagsInput::make('tags')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/tags-input/simple" alt="Tags input" version="3.x" />

If you're saving the JSON tags using Eloquent, you should be sure to add an `array` [cast](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-mutators#array-and-json-casting) to the model property:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Post extends Model
{
    protected $casts = [
        'tags' => 'array',
    ];

    // ...
}
```

> Filament also supports [`spatie/laravel-tags`](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-tags). See our [plugin documentation](/plugins/filament-spatie-tags) for more information.

## Comma-separated tags

You may allow the tags to be stored in a separated string, instead of JSON. To set this up, pass the separating character to the `separator()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TagsInput;

TagsInput::make('tags')
    ->separator(',')
```

## Autocompleting tag suggestions

Tags inputs may have autocomplete suggestions. To enable this, pass an array of suggestions to the `suggestions()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TagsInput;

TagsInput::make('tags')
    ->suggestions([
        'tailwindcss',
        'alpinejs',
        'laravel',
        'livewire',
    ])
```

## Defining split keys

Split keys allow you to map specific buttons on your user's keyboard to create a new tag. By default, when the user presses "Enter", a new tag is created in the input. You may also define other keys to create new tags, such as "Tab" or " ". To do this, pass an array of keys to the `splitKeys()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TagsInput;

TagsInput::make('tags')
    ->splitKeys(['Tab', ' '])
```

You can [read more about possible options for keys](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/key).

## Adding a prefix and suffix to individual tags

You can add prefix and suffix to tags without modifying the real state of the field. This can be useful if you need to show presentational formatting to users without saving it. This is done with the `tagPrefix()` or `tagSuffix()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TagsInput;

TagsInput::make('percentages')
    ->tagSuffix('%')
```

## Reordering tags

You can allow the user to reorder tags within the field using the `reorderable()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TagsInput;

TagsInput::make('tags')
    ->reorderable()
```

## Changing the color of tags

You can change the color of the tags by passing a color to the `color()` method. It may be either `danger`, `gray`, `info`, `primary`, `success` or `warning`:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TagsInput;

TagsInput::make('tags')
    ->color('danger')
```

## Tags validation

You may add validation rules for each tag by passing an array of rules to the `nestedRecursiveRules()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TagsInput;

TagsInput::make('tags')
    ->nestedRecursiveRules([
        'min:3',
        'max:255',
    ])
```

# Documentation for forms. File: 03-fields/15-textarea.md
---
title: Textarea
---
import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"

## Overview

The textarea allows you to interact with a multi-line string:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Textarea;

Textarea::make('description')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/textarea/simple" alt="Textarea" version="3.x" />

## Resizing the textarea

You may change the size of the textarea by defining the `rows()` and `cols()` methods:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Textarea;

Textarea::make('description')
    ->rows(10)
    ->cols(20)
```

### Autosizing the textarea

You may allow the textarea to automatically resize to fit its content by setting the `autosize()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Textarea;

Textarea::make('description')
    ->autosize()
```

## Making the field read-only

Not to be confused with [disabling the field](getting-started#disabling-a-field), you may make the field "read-only" using the `readOnly()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Textarea;

Textarea::make('description')
    ->readOnly()
```

There are a few differences, compared to [`disabled()`](getting-started#disabling-a-field):

- When using `readOnly()`, the field will still be sent to the server when the form is submitted. It can be mutated with the browser console, or via JavaScript. You can use [`dehydrated(false)`](../advanced#preventing-a-field-from-being-dehydrated) to prevent this.
- There are no styling changes, such as less opacity, when using `readOnly()`.
- The field is still focusable when using `readOnly()`.

## Textarea validation

As well as all rules listed on the [validation](../validation) page, there are additional rules that are specific to textareas.

### Length validation

You may limit the length of the textarea by setting the `minLength()` and `maxLength()` methods. These methods add both frontend and backend validation:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Textarea;

Textarea::make('description')
    ->minLength(2)
    ->maxLength(1024)
```

You can also specify the exact length of the textarea by setting the `length()`. This method adds both frontend and backend validation:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Textarea;

Textarea::make('question')
    ->length(100)
```

# Documentation for forms. File: 03-fields/16-key-value.md
---
title: Key-value
---
import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"

## Overview

The key-value field allows you to interact with one-dimensional JSON object:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\KeyValue;

KeyValue::make('meta')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/key-value/simple" alt="Key-value" version="3.x" />

If you're saving the data in Eloquent, you should be sure to add an `array` [cast](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-mutators#array-and-json-casting) to the model property:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Post extends Model
{
    protected $casts = [
        'meta' => 'array',
    ];

    // ...
}
```

## Adding rows

An action button is displayed below the field to allow the user to add a new row.

## Setting the add action button's label

You may set a label to customize the text that should be displayed in the button for adding a row, using the `addActionLabel()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\KeyValue;

KeyValue::make('meta')
    ->addActionLabel('Add property')
```

### Preventing the user from adding rows

You may prevent the user from adding rows using the `addable(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\KeyValue;

KeyValue::make('meta')
    ->addable(false)
```

## Deleting rows

An action button is displayed on each item to allow the user to delete it.

### Preventing the user from deleting rows

You may prevent the user from deleting rows using the `deletable(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\KeyValue;

KeyValue::make('meta')
    ->deletable(false)
```

## Editing keys

### Customizing the key fields' label

You may customize the label for the key fields using the `keyLabel()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\KeyValue;

KeyValue::make('meta')
    ->keyLabel('Property name')
```

### Adding key field placeholders

You may also add placeholders for the key fields using the `keyPlaceholder()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\KeyValue;

KeyValue::make('meta')
    ->keyPlaceholder('Property name')
```

### Preventing the user from editing keys

You may prevent the user from editing keys using the `editableKeys(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\KeyValue;

KeyValue::make('meta')
    ->editableKeys(false)
```

## Editing values

### Customizing the value fields' label

You may customize the label for the value fields using the `valueLabel()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\KeyValue;

KeyValue::make('meta')
    ->valueLabel('Property value')
```

### Adding value field placeholders

You may also add placeholders for the value fields using the `valuePlaceholder()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\KeyValue;

KeyValue::make('meta')
    ->valuePlaceholder('Property value')
```

### Preventing the user from editing values

You may prevent the user from editing values using the `editableValues(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\KeyValue;

KeyValue::make('meta')
    ->editableValues(false)
```

## Reordering rows

You can allow the user to reorder rows within the table using the `reorderable()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\KeyValue;

KeyValue::make('meta')
    ->reorderable()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/key-value/reorderable" alt="Key-value with reorderable rows" version="3.x" />

## Customizing the key-value action objects

This field uses action objects for easy customization of buttons within it. You can customize these buttons by passing a function to an action registration method. The function has access to the `$action` object, which you can use to [customize it](../../actions/trigger-button). The following methods are available to customize the actions:

- `addAction()`
- `deleteAction()`
- `reorderAction()`

Here is an example of how you might customize an action:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Forms\Components\KeyValue;

KeyValue::make('meta')
    ->deleteAction(
        fn (Action $action) => $action->icon('heroicon-m-x-mark'),
    )
```

import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"

## Overview

The color picker component allows you to pick a color in a range of formats.

By default, the component uses HEX format:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\ColorPicker;

ColorPicker::make('color')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/color-picker/simple" alt="Color picker" version="3.x" />

## Setting the color format

While HEX format is used by default, you can choose which color format to use:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\ColorPicker;

ColorPicker::make('hsl_color')
    ->hsl()

ColorPicker::make('rgb_color')
    ->rgb()

ColorPicker::make('rgba_color')
    ->rgba()
```

## Color picker validation

You may use Laravel's validation rules to validate the values of the color picker:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\ColorPicker;

ColorPicker::make('hex_color')
    ->regex('/^#([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})\b$/')

ColorPicker::make('hsl_color')
    ->hsl()
    ->regex('/^hsl\(\s*(\d+)\s*,\s*(\d*(?:\.\d+)?%)\s*,\s*(\d*(?:\.\d+)?%)\)$/')

ColorPicker::make('rgb_color')
    ->rgb()
    ->regex('/^rgb\((\d{1,3}),\s*(\d{1,3}),\s*(\d{1,3})\)$/')

ColorPicker::make('rgba_color')
    ->rgba()
    ->regex('/^rgba\((\d{1,3}),\s*(\d{1,3}),\s*(\d{1,3}),\s*(\d*(?:\.\d+)?)\)$/')
```

# Documentation for forms. File: 03-fields/18-toggle-buttons.md
---
title: Toggle buttons
---
import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"

## Overview

The toggle buttons input provides a group of buttons for selecting a single value, or multiple values, from a list of predefined options:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\ToggleButtons;

ToggleButtons::make('status')
    ->options([
        'draft' => 'Draft',
        'scheduled' => 'Scheduled',
        'published' => 'Published'
    ])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/toggle-buttons/simple" alt="Toggle buttons" version="3.x" />

## Changing the color of option buttons

You can change the color of the option buttons using the `colors()` method. Each key in the array should correspond to an option value, and the value may be either `danger`, `gray`, `info`, `primary`, `success` or `warning`:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\ToggleButtons;

ToggleButtons::make('status')
    ->options([
        'draft' => 'Draft',
        'scheduled' => 'Scheduled',
        'published' => 'Published'
    ])
    ->colors([
        'draft' => 'info',
        'scheduled' => 'warning',
        'published' => 'success',
    ])
```

If you are using an enum for the options, you can use the [`HasColor` interface](../../support/enums#enum-colors) to define colors instead.

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/toggle-buttons/colors" alt="Toggle buttons with different colors" version="3.x" />

## Adding icons to option buttons

You can add [icon](https://blade-ui-kit.com/blade-icons?set=1#search) to the option buttons using the `icons()` method. Each key in the array should correspond to an option value, and the value may be any valid [Blade icon](https://blade-ui-kit.com/blade-icons?set=1#search):

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\ToggleButtons;

ToggleButtons::make('status')
    ->options([
        'draft' => 'Draft',
        'scheduled' => 'Scheduled',
        'published' => 'Published'
    ])
    ->icons([
        'draft' => 'heroicon-o-pencil',
        'scheduled' => 'heroicon-o-clock',
        'published' => 'heroicon-o-check-circle',
    ])
```

If you are using an enum for the options, you can use the [`HasIcon` interface](../../support/enums#enum-icons) to define icons instead.

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/toggle-buttons/icons" alt="Toggle buttons with icons" version="3.x" />

If you want to display only icons, you can use `hiddenButtonLabels()` to hide the option labels.

## Boolean options

If you want a simple boolean toggle button group, with "Yes" and "No" options, you can use the `boolean()` method:

```php
ToggleButtons::make('feedback')
    ->label('Like this post?')
    ->boolean()
```

The options will have [colors](#changing-the-color-of-option-buttons) and [icons](#adding-icons-to-option-buttons) set up automatically, but you can override these with `colors()` or `icons()`.

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/toggle-buttons/boolean" alt="Boolean toggle buttons" version="3.x" />

## Positioning the options inline with each other

You may wish to display the options `inline()` with each other:

```php
ToggleButtons::make('feedback')
    ->label('Like this post?')
    ->boolean()
    ->inline()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/toggle-buttons/inline" alt="Inline toggle buttons" version="3.x" />

## Grouping option buttons

You may wish to group option buttons together so they are more compact, using the `grouped()` method. This also makes them appear horizontally inline with each other:

```php
ToggleButtons::make('feedback')
    ->label('Like this post?')
    ->boolean()
    ->grouped()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/toggle-buttons/grouped" alt="Grouped toggle buttons" version="3.x" />

## Selecting multiple buttons

The `multiple()` method on the `ToggleButtons` component allows you to select multiple values from the list of options:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\ToggleButtons;

ToggleButtons::make('technologies')
    ->multiple()
    ->options([
        'tailwind' => 'Tailwind CSS',
        'alpine' => 'Alpine.js',
        'laravel' => 'Laravel',
        'livewire' => 'Laravel Livewire',
    ])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/toggle-buttons/multiple" alt="Multiple toggle buttons selected" version="3.x" />

These options are returned in JSON format. If you're saving them using Eloquent, you should be sure to add an `array` [cast](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-mutators#array-and-json-casting) to the model property:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class App extends Model
{
    protected $casts = [
        'technologies' => 'array',
    ];

    // ...
}
```

## Splitting options into columns

You may split options into columns by using the `columns()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\ToggleButtons;

ToggleButtons::make('technologies')
    ->options([
        // ...
    ])
    ->columns(2)
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/toggle-buttons/columns" alt="Toggle buttons with 2 columns" version="3.x" />

This method accepts the same options as the `columns()` method of the [grid](layout/grid). This allows you to responsively customize the number of columns at various breakpoints.

### Setting the grid direction

By default, when you arrange buttons into columns, they will be listed in order vertically. If you'd like to list them horizontally, you may use the `gridDirection('row')` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\ToggleButtons;

ToggleButtons::make('technologies')
    ->options([
        // ...
    ])
    ->columns(2)
    ->gridDirection('row')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/toggle-buttons/rows" alt="Toggle buttons with 2 rows" version="3.x" />

## Disabling specific options

You can disable specific options using the `disableOptionWhen()` method. It accepts a closure, in which you can check if the option with a specific `$value` should be disabled:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\ToggleButtons;

ToggleButtons::make('status')
    ->options([
        'draft' => 'Draft',
        'scheduled' => 'Scheduled',
        'published' => 'Published',
    ])
    ->disableOptionWhen(fn (string $value): bool => $value === 'published')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/toggle-buttons/disabled-option" alt="Toggle buttons with disabled option" version="3.x" />

If you want to retrieve the options that have not been disabled, e.g. for validation purposes, you can do so using `getEnabledOptions()`:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\ToggleButtons;

ToggleButtons::make('status')
    ->options([
        'draft' => 'Draft',
        'scheduled' => 'Scheduled',
        'published' => 'Published',
    ])
    ->disableOptionWhen(fn (string $value): bool => $value === 'published')
    ->in(fn (ToggleButtons $component): array => array_keys($component->getEnabledOptions()))
```

# Documentation for forms. File: 03-fields/19-hidden.md
---
title: Hidden
---

## Overview

The hidden component allows you to create a hidden field in your form that holds a value.

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Hidden;

Hidden::make('token')
```

Please be aware that the value of this field is still editable by the user if they decide to use the browser's developer tools. You should not use this component to store sensitive or read-only information.

import LaracastsBanner from "@components/LaracastsBanner.astro"

<LaracastsBanner
    title="Build a Custom Form Field"
    description="Watch the Build Advanced Components for Filament series on Laracasts - it will teach you how to build components, and you'll get to know all the internal tools to help you."
    url="https://laracasts.com/series/build-advanced-components-for-filament/episodes/6"
    series="building-advanced-components"
/>

## View fields

Aside from [building custom fields](#custom-field-classes), you may create "view" fields which allow you to create custom fields without extra PHP classes.

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\ViewField;

ViewField::make('rating')
    ->view('filament.forms.components.range-slider')
```

This assumes that you have a `resources/views/filament/forms/components/range-slider.blade.php` file.

### Passing data to view fields

You can pass a simple array of data to the view using `viewData()`:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\ViewField;

ViewField::make('rating')
    ->view('filament.forms.components.range-slider')
    ->viewData([
        'min' => 1,
        'max' => 5,
    ])
```

However, more complex configuration can be achieved with a [custom field class](#custom-field-classes).

## Custom field classes

You may create your own custom field classes and views, which you can reuse across your project, and even release as a plugin to the community.

> If you're just creating a simple custom field to use once, you could instead use a [view field](#view) to render any custom Blade file.

To create a custom field class and view, you may use the following command:

```bash
php artisan make:form-field RangeSlider
```

This will create the following field class:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Field;

class RangeSlider extends Field
{
    protected string $view = 'filament.forms.components.range-slider';
}
```

It will also create a view file at `resources/views/filament/forms/components/range-slider.blade.php`.

## How fields work

Livewire components are PHP classes that have their state stored in the user's browser. When a network request is made, the state is sent to the server, and filled into public properties on the Livewire component class, where it can be accessed in the same way as any other class property in PHP can be.

Imagine you had a Livewire component with a public property called `$name`. You could bind that property to an input field in the HTML of the Livewire component in one of two ways: with the [`wire:model` attribute](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/properties#data-binding), or by [entangling](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/javascript#the-wire-object) it with an Alpine.js property:

```blade
<input wire:model="name" />

<!-- Or -->

<div x-data="{ state: $wire.$entangle('name') }">
    <input x-model="state" />
</div>
```

When the user types into the input field, the `$name` property is updated in the Livewire component class. When the user submits the form, the `$name` property is sent to the server, where it can be saved.

This is the basis of how fields work in Filament. Each field is assigned to a public property in the Livewire component class, which is where the state of the field is stored. We call the name of this property the "state path" of the field. You can access the state path of a field using the `$getStatePath()` function in the field's view:

```blade
<input wire:model="{{ $getStatePath() }}" />

<!-- Or -->

<div x-data="{ state: $wire.$entangle('{{ $getStatePath() }}') }">
    <input x-model="state" />
</div>
```

If your component heavily relies on third party libraries, we advise that you asynchronously load the Alpine.js component using the Filament asset system. This ensures that the Alpine.js component is only loaded when it's needed, and not on every page load. To find out how to do this, check out our [Assets documentation](../../support/assets#asynchronous-alpinejs-components).

## Rendering the field wrapper

Filament includes a "field wrapper" component, which is able to render the field's label, validation errors, and any other text surrounding the field. You may render the field wrapper like this in the view:

```blade
<x-dynamic-component
    :component="$getFieldWrapperView()"
    :field="$field"
>
    <!-- Field -->
</x-dynamic-component>
```

It's encouraged to use the field wrapper component whenever appropriate, as it will ensure that the field's design is consistent with the rest of the form.

## Accessing the Eloquent record

Inside your view, you may access the Eloquent record using the `$getRecord()` function:

```blade
<div>
    {{ $getRecord()->name }}
</div>
```

## Obeying state binding modifiers

When you bind a field to a state path, you may use the `defer` modifier to ensure that the state is only sent to the server when the user submits the form, or whenever the next Livewire request is made. This is the default behavior.

However, you may use the [`live()`](../advanced#the-basics-of-reactivity) on a field to ensure that the state is sent to the server immediately when the user interacts with the field. This allows for lots of advanced use cases as explained in the [advanced](../advanced) section of the documentation.

Filament provides a `$applyStateBindingModifiers()` function that you may use in your view to apply any state binding modifiers to a `wire:model` or `$wire.$entangle()` binding:

```blade
<input {{ $applyStateBindingModifiers('wire:model') }}="{{ $getStatePath() }}" />

<!-- Or -->

<div x-data="{ state: $wire.{{ $applyStateBindingModifiers("\$entangle('{$getStatePath()}')") }} }">
    <input x-model="state" />
</div>
```

title: Getting started

import LaracastsBanner from "@components/LaracastsBanner.astro"

## Overview

<LaracastsBanner
    title="Layouts"
    description="Watch the Rapid Laravel Development with Filament series on Laracasts - it will teach you the basics of customizing the layout of a Filament form."
    url="https://laracasts.com/series/rapid-laravel-development-with-filament/episodes/6"
    series="rapid-laravel-development"
/>

Filament forms are not limited to just displaying fields. You can also use "layout components" to organize them into an infinitely nestable structure.

Layout component classes can be found in the `Filament\Forms\Components` namespace. They reside within the schema of your form, alongside any [fields](fields/getting-started).

Components may be created using the static `make()` method. Usually, you will then define the child component `schema()` to display inside:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Grid;

Grid::make(2)
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
```

## Available layout components

Filament ships with some layout components, suitable for arranging your form fields depending on your needs:

- [Grid](grid)
- [Fieldset](fieldset)
- [Tabs](tabs)
- [Wizard](wizard)
- [Section](section)
- [Split](split)
- [Placeholder](placeholder)

You may also [create your own custom layout components](custom) to organize fields however you wish.

## Setting an ID

You may define an ID for the component using the `id()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Section;

Section::make()
    ->id('main-section')
```

## Adding extra HTML attributes

You can pass extra HTML attributes to the component, which will be merged onto the outer DOM element. Pass an array of attributes to the `extraAttributes()` method, where the key is the attribute name and the value is the attribute value:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Section;

Section::make()
    ->extraAttributes(['class' => 'custom-section-style'])
```

Classes will be merged with the default classes, and any other attributes will override the default attributes.

## Global settings

If you wish to change the default behavior of a component globally, then you can call the static `configureUsing()` method inside a service provider's `boot()` method, to which you pass a Closure to modify the component using. For example, if you wish to make all section components have [2 columns](grid) by default, you can do it like so:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Section;

Section::configureUsing(function (Section $section): void {
    $section
        ->columns(2);
});
```

Of course, you are still able to overwrite this on each field individually:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Section;

Section::make()
    ->columns(1)
```

# Documentation for forms. File: 04-layout/02-grid.md
---
title: Grid
---

## Overview

Filament's grid system allows you to create responsive, multi-column layouts using any layout component.

## Responsively setting the number of grid columns

All layout components have a `columns()` method that you can use in a couple of different ways:

- You can pass an integer like `columns(2)`. This integer is the number of columns used on the `lg` breakpoint and higher. All smaller devices will have just 1 column.
- You can pass an array, where the key is the breakpoint and the value is the number of columns. For example, `columns(['md' => 2, 'xl' => 4])` will create a 2 column layout on medium devices, and a 4 column layout on extra large devices. The default breakpoint for smaller devices uses 1 column, unless you use a `default` array key.

Breakpoints (`sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, `2xl`) are defined by Tailwind, and can be found in the [Tailwind documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design#overview).

## Controlling how many columns a component should span

In addition to specifying how many columns a layout component should have, you may also specify how many columns a component should fill within the parent grid, using the `columnSpan()` method. This method accepts an integer or an array of breakpoints and column spans:

- `columnSpan(2)` will make the component fill up to 2 columns on all breakpoints.
- `columnSpan(['md' => 2, 'xl' => 4])` will make the component fill up to 2 columns on medium devices, and up to 4 columns on extra large devices. The default breakpoint for smaller devices uses 1 column, unless you use a `default` array key.
- `columnSpan('full')` or `columnSpanFull()` or `columnSpan(['default' => 'full'])` will make the component fill the full width of the parent grid, regardless of how many columns it has.

## An example of a responsive grid layout

In this example, we have a form with a [section](section) layout component. Since all layout components support the `columns()` method, we can use it to create a responsive grid layout within the section itself.

We pass an array to `columns()` as we want to specify different numbers of columns for different breakpoints. On devices smaller than the `sm` [Tailwind breakpoint](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design#overview), we want to have 1 column, which is default. On devices larger than the `sm` breakpoint, we want to have 3 columns. On devices larger than the `xl` breakpoint, we want to have 6 columns. On devices larger than the `2xl` breakpoint, we want to have 8 columns.

Inside the section, we have a [text input](../fields/text-input). Since text inputs are form components and all form components have a `columnSpan()` method, we can use it to specify how many columns the text input should fill. On devices smaller than the `sm` breakpoint, we want the text input to fill 1 column, which is default. On devices larger than the `sm` breakpoint, we want the text input to fill 2 columns. On devices larger than the `xl` breakpoint, we want the text input to fill 3 columns. On devices larger than the `2xl` breakpoint, we want the text input to fill 4 columns.

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Section;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

Section::make()
    ->columns([
        'sm' => 3,
        'xl' => 6,
        '2xl' => 8,
    ])
    ->schema([
        TextInput::make('name')
            ->columnSpan([
                'sm' => 2,
                'xl' => 3,
                '2xl' => 4,
            ]),
        // ...
    ])
```

## Grid component

All layout components support the `columns()` method, but you also have access to an additional `Grid` component. If you feel that your form schema would benefit from an explicit grid syntax with no extra styling, it may be useful to you. Instead of using the `columns()` method, you can pass your column configuration directly to `Grid::make()`:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Grid;

Grid::make([
    'default' => 1,
    'sm' => 2,
    'md' => 3,
    'lg' => 4,
    'xl' => 6,
    '2xl' => 8,
])
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
```

## Setting the starting column of a component in a grid

If you want to start a component in a grid at a specific column, you can use the `columnStart()` method. This method accepts an integer, or an array of breakpoints and which column the component should start at:

- `columnStart(2)` will make the component start at column 2 on all breakpoints.
- `columnStart(['md' => 2, 'xl' => 4])` will make the component start at column 2 on medium devices, and at column 4 on extra large devices. The default breakpoint for smaller devices uses 1 column, unless you use a `default` array key.

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Section;

Section::make()
    ->columns([
        'sm' => 3,
        'xl' => 6,
        '2xl' => 8,
    ])
    ->schema([
        TextInput::make('name')
            ->columnStart([
                'sm' => 2,
                'xl' => 3,
                '2xl' => 4,
            ]),
        // ...
    ])
```

In this example, the grid has 3 columns on small devices, 6 columns on extra large devices, and 8 columns on extra extra large devices. The text input will start at column 2 on small devices, column 3 on extra large devices, and column 4 on extra extra large devices. This is essentially producing a layout whereby the text input always starts halfway through the grid, regardless of how many columns the grid has.

# Documentation for forms. File: 04-layout/03-fieldset.md
---
title: Fieldset
---
import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"

## Overview

You may want to group fields into a Fieldset. Each fieldset has a label, a border, and a two-column grid by default:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Fieldset;

Fieldset::make('Label')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/layout/fieldset/simple" alt="Fieldset" version="3.x" />

## Using grid columns within a fieldset

You may use the `columns()` method to customize the [grid](grid) within the fieldset:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Fieldset;

Fieldset::make('Label')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->columns(3)
```

# Documentation for forms. File: 04-layout/04-tabs.md
---
title: Tabs
---
import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"

## Overview

Some forms can be long and complex. You may want to use tabs to reduce the number of components that are visible at once:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Tabs;

Tabs::make('Tabs')
    ->tabs([
        Tabs\Tab::make('Tab 1')
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]),
        Tabs\Tab::make('Tab 2')
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]),
        Tabs\Tab::make('Tab 3')
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]),
    ])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/layout/tabs/simple" alt="Tabs" version="3.x" />

## Setting the default active tab

The first tab will be open by default. You can change the default open tab using the `activeTab()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Tabs;

Tabs::make('Tabs')
    ->tabs([
        Tabs\Tab::make('Tab 1')
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]),
        Tabs\Tab::make('Tab 2')
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]),
        Tabs\Tab::make('Tab 3')
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]),
    ])
    ->activeTab(2)
```

## Setting a tab icon

Tabs may have an [icon](https://blade-ui-kit.com/blade-icons?set=1#search), which you can set using the `icon()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Tabs;

Tabs::make('Tabs')
    ->tabs([
        Tabs\Tab::make('Notifications')
            ->icon('heroicon-m-bell')
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]),
        // ...
    ])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/layout/tabs/icons" alt="Tabs with icons" version="3.x" />

### Setting the tab icon position

The icon of the tab may be positioned before or after the label using the `iconPosition()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Tabs;
use Filament\Support\Enums\IconPosition;

Tabs::make('Tabs')
    ->tabs([
        Tabs\Tab::make('Notifications')
            ->icon('heroicon-m-bell')
            ->iconPosition(IconPosition::After)
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]),
        // ...
    ])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/layout/tabs/icons-after" alt="Tabs with icons after their labels" version="3.x" />

## Setting a tab badge

Tabs may have a badge, which you can set using the `badge()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Tabs;

Tabs::make('Tabs')
    ->tabs([
        Tabs\Tab::make('Notifications')
            ->badge(5)
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]),
        // ...
    ])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/layout/tabs/badges" alt="Tabs with badges" version="3.x" />

If you'd like to change the color for a badge, you can use the `badgeColor()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Tabs;

Tabs::make('Tabs')
    ->tabs([
        Tabs\Tab::make('Notifications')
            ->badge(5)
            ->badgeColor('success')
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]),
        // ...
    ])
```

## Using grid columns within a tab

You may use the `columns()` method to customize the [grid](grid) within the tab:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Tabs;

Tabs::make('Tabs')
    ->tabs([
        Tabs\Tab::make('Tab 1')
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ])
            ->columns(3),
        // ...
    ])
```

## Removing the styled container

By default, tabs and their content are wrapped in a container styled as a card. You may remove the styled container using `contained()`:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Tabs;

Tabs::make('Tabs')
    ->tabs([
        Tabs\Tab::make('Tab 1')
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]),
        Tabs\Tab::make('Tab 2')
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]),
        Tabs\Tab::make('Tab 3')
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]),
    ])
    ->contained(false)
```

## Persisting the current tab

By default, the current tab is not persisted in the browser's local storage. You can change this behavior using the `persistTab()` method. You must also pass in a unique `id()` for the tabs component, to distinguish it from all other sets of tabs in the app. This ID will be used as the key in the local storage to store the current tab:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Tabs;

Tabs::make('Tabs')
    ->tabs([
        // ...
    ])
    ->persistTab()
    ->id('order-tabs')
```

### Persisting the current tab in the URL's query string

By default, the current tab is not persisted in the URL's query string. You can change this behavior using the `persistTabInQueryString()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Tabs;

Tabs::make('Tabs')
    ->tabs([
        Tabs\Tab::make('Tab 1')
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]),
        Tabs\Tab::make('Tab 2')
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]),
        Tabs\Tab::make('Tab 3')
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]),
    ])
    ->persistTabInQueryString()
```

By default, the current tab is persisted in the URL's query string using the `tab` key. You can change this key by passing it to the `persistTabInQueryString()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Tabs;

Tabs::make('Tabs')
    ->tabs([
        Tabs\Tab::make('Tab 1')
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]),
        Tabs\Tab::make('Tab 2')
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]),
        Tabs\Tab::make('Tab 3')
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]),
    ])
    ->persistTabInQueryString('settings-tab')
```


# Documentation for forms. File: 04-layout/05-wizard.md
---
title: Wizard
---
import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"

## Overview

Similar to [tabs](tabs), you may want to use a multistep form wizard to reduce the number of components that are visible at once. These are especially useful if your form has a definite chronological order, in which you want each step to be validated as the user progresses.

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Wizard;

Wizard::make([
    Wizard\Step::make('Order')
        ->schema([
            // ...
        ]),
    Wizard\Step::make('Delivery')
        ->schema([
            // ...
        ]),
    Wizard\Step::make('Billing')
        ->schema([
            // ...
        ]),
])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/layout/wizard/simple" alt="Wizard" version="3.x" />

> We have different setup instructions if you're looking to add a wizard to the creation process inside a [panel resource](../../panels/resources/creating-records#using-a-wizard) or an [action modal](../../actions/modals#using-a-wizard-as-a-modal-form). Following that documentation will ensure that the ability to submit the form is only available on the last step of the wizard.

## Rendering a submit button on the last step

You may use the `submitAction()` method to render submit button HTML or a view at the end of the wizard, on the last step. This provides a clearer UX than displaying a submit button below the wizard at all times:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Wizard;
use Illuminate\Support\HtmlString;

Wizard::make([
    // ...
])->submitAction(view('order-form.submit-button'))

Wizard::make([
    // ...
])->submitAction(new HtmlString('<button type="submit">Submit</button>'))
```

Alternatively, you can use the built-in Filament button Blade component:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Wizard;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Blade;
use Illuminate\Support\HtmlString;

Wizard::make([
    // ...
])->submitAction(new HtmlString(Blade::render(<<<BLADE
    <x-filament::button
        type="submit"
        size="sm"
    >
        Submit
    </x-filament::button>
BLADE)))
```

You could use this component in a separate Blade view if you want.

## Setting up step icons

Steps may also have an [icon](https://blade-ui-kit.com/blade-icons?set=1#search), set using the `icon()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Wizard;

Wizard\Step::make('Order')
    ->icon('heroicon-m-shopping-bag')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ]),
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/layout/wizard/icons" alt="Wizard with step icons" version="3.x" />

## Customizing the icon for completed steps

You may customize the [icon](#setting-up-step-icons) of a completed step using the `completedIcon()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Wizard;

Wizard\Step::make('Order')
    ->completedIcon('heroicon-m-hand-thumb-up')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ]),
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/layout/wizard/completed-icons" alt="Wizard with completed step icons" version="3.x" />

## Adding descriptions to steps

You may add a short description after the title of each step using the `description()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Wizard;

Wizard\Step::make('Order')
    ->description('Review your basket')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ]),
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/layout/wizard/descriptions" alt="Wizard with step descriptions" version="3.x" />

## Setting the default active step

You may use the `startOnStep()` method to load a specific step in the wizard:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Wizard;

Wizard::make([
    // ...
])->startOnStep(2)
```

## Allowing steps to be skipped

If you'd like to allow free navigation, so all steps are skippable, use the `skippable()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Wizard;

Wizard::make([
    // ...
])->skippable()
```

## Persisting the current step in the URL's query string

By default, the current step is not persisted in the URL's query string. You can change this behavior using the `persistStepInQueryString()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Wizard;

Wizard::make([
    // ...
])->persistStepInQueryString()
```

By default, the current step is persisted in the URL's query string using the `step` key. You can change this key by passing it to the `persistStepInQueryString()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Wizard;

Wizard::make([
    // ...
])->persistStepInQueryString('wizard-step')
```

## Step lifecycle hooks

You may use the `afterValidation()` and `beforeValidation()` methods to run code before and after validation occurs on the step:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Wizard;

Wizard\Step::make('Order')
    ->afterValidation(function () {
        // ...
    })
    ->beforeValidation(function () {
        // ...
    })
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ]),
```

### Preventing the next step from being loaded

Inside `afterValidation()` or `beforeValidation()`, you may throw `Filament\Support\Exceptions\Halt`, which will prevent the wizard from loading the next step:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Wizard;
use Filament\Support\Exceptions\Halt;

Wizard\Step::make('Order')
    ->afterValidation(function () {
        // ...

        if (true) {
            throw new Halt();
        }
    })
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ]),
```

## Using grid columns within a step

You may use the `columns()` method to customize the [grid](grid) within the step:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Wizard;

Wizard::make([
    Wizard\Step::make('Order')
        ->columns(2)
        ->schema([
            // ...
        ]),
    // ...
])
```

## Customizing the wizard action objects

This component uses action objects for easy customization of buttons within it. You can customize these buttons by passing a function to an action registration method. The function has access to the `$action` object, which you can use to [customize it](../../actions/trigger-button). The following methods are available to customize the actions:

- `nextAction()`
- `previousAction()`

Here is an example of how you might customize an action:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Wizard;

Wizard::make([
    // ...
])
    ->nextAction(
        fn (Action $action) => $action->label('Next step'),
    )
```

# Documentation for forms. File: 04-layout/06-section.md
---
title: Section
---
import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"

## Overview

You may want to separate your fields into sections, each with a heading and description. To do this, you can use a section component:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Section;

Section::make('Rate limiting')
    ->description('Prevent abuse by limiting the number of requests per period')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/layout/section/simple" alt="Section" version="3.x" />

You can also use a section without a header, which just wraps the components in a simple card:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Section;

Section::make()
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/layout/section/without-header" alt="Section without header" version="3.x" />

## Adding actions to the section's header or footer

Sections can have actions in their [header](#adding-actions-to-the-sections-header) or [footer](#adding-actions-to-the-sections-footer).

### Adding actions to the section's header

You may add [actions](../actions) to the section's header using the `headerActions()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Section;

Section::make('Rate limiting')
    ->headerActions([
        Action::make('test')
            ->action(function () {
                // ...
            }),
    ])
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/layout/section/header/actions" alt="Section with header actions" version="3.x" />

> [Make sure the section has a heading or ID](#adding-actions-to-a-section-without-heading)

### Adding actions to the section's footer

In addition to [header actions](#adding-an-icon-to-the-sections-header), you may add [actions](../actions) to the section's footer using the `footerActions()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Section;

Section::make('Rate limiting')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->footerActions([
        Action::make('test')
            ->action(function () {
                // ...
            }),
    ])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/layout/section/footer/actions" alt="Section with footer actions" version="3.x" />

> [Make sure the section has a heading or ID](#adding-actions-to-a-section-without-heading)

#### Aligning section footer actions

Footer actions are aligned to the inline start by default. You may customize the alignment using the `footerActionsAlignment()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Section;
use Filament\Support\Enums\Alignment;

Section::make('Rate limiting')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->footerActions([
        Action::make('test')
            ->action(function () {
                // ...
            }),
    ])
    ->footerActionsAlignment(Alignment::End)
```

### Adding actions to a section without heading

If your section does not have a heading, Filament has no way of locating the action inside it. In this case, you must pass a unique `id()` to the section:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Section;

Section::make()
    ->id('rateLimitingSection')
    ->headerActions([
        // ...
    ])
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
```

## Adding an icon to the section's header

You may add an [icon](https://blade-ui-kit.com/blade-icons?set=1#search) to the section's header using the `icon()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Section;

Section::make('Cart')
    ->description('The items you have selected for purchase')
    ->icon('heroicon-m-shopping-bag')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/layout/section/icons" alt="Section with icon" version="3.x" />

## Positioning the heading and description aside

You may use the `aside()` to align heading & description on the left, and the form components inside a card on the right:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Section;

Section::make('Rate limiting')
    ->description('Prevent abuse by limiting the number of requests per period')
    ->aside()
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/layout/section/aside" alt="Section with heading and description aside" version="3.x" />

## Collapsing sections

Sections may be `collapsible()` to optionally hide content in long forms:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Section;

Section::make('Cart')
    ->description('The items you have selected for purchase')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->collapsible()
```

Your sections may be `collapsed()` by default:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Section;

Section::make('Cart')
    ->description('The items you have selected for purchase')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->collapsed()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/layout/section/collapsed" alt="Collapsed section" version="3.x" />

### Persisting collapsed sections

You can persist whether a section is collapsed in local storage using the `persistCollapsed()` method, so it will remain collapsed when the user refreshes the page:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\Section;

Section::make('Cart')
    ->description('The items you have selected for purchase')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->collapsible()
    ->persistCollapsed()
```

To persist the collapse state, the local storage needs a unique ID to store the state. This ID is generated based on the heading of the section. If your section does not have a heading, or if you have multiple sections with the same heading that you do not want to collapse together, you can manually specify the `id()` of that section to prevent an ID conflict:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\Section;

Section::make('Cart')
    ->description('The items you have selected for purchase')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->collapsible()
    ->persistCollapsed()
    ->id('order-cart')
```

## Compact section styling

When nesting sections, you can use a more compact styling:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Section;

Section::make('Rate limiting')
    ->description('Prevent abuse by limiting the number of requests per period')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->compact()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/layout/section/compact" alt="Compact section" version="3.x" />

## Using grid columns within a section

You may use the `columns()` method to easily create a [grid](grid) within the section:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Section;

Section::make('Heading')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->columns(2)
```

# Documentation for forms. File: 04-layout/07-split.md
---
title: Split
---
import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"

## Overview

The `Split` component allows you to define layouts with flexible widths, using flexbox.

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Section;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Split;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Textarea;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Toggle;

Split::make([
    Section::make([
        TextInput::make('title'),
        Textarea::make('content'),
    ]),
    Section::make([
        Toggle::make('is_published'),
        Toggle::make('is_featured'),
    ])->grow(false),
])->from('md')
```

In this example, the first section will `grow()` to consume available horizontal space, without affecting the amount of space needed to render the second section. This creates a sidebar effect.

The `from()` method is used to control the [Tailwind breakpoint](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design#overview) (`sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, `2xl`) at which the split layout should be used. In this example, the split layout will be used on medium devices and larger. On smaller devices, the sections will stack on top of each other.

title: Custom layouts
---
import LaracastsBanner from "@components/LaracastsBanner.astro"

<LaracastsBanner
    title="Build a Custom Form Layout"
    description="Watch the Build Advanced Components for Filament series on Laracasts - it will teach you how to build components, and you'll get to know all the internal tools to help you."
    url="https://laracasts.com/series/build-advanced-components-for-filament/episodes/7"
    series="building-advanced-components"
/>

## View components

Aside from [building custom layout components](#custom-layout-classes), you may create "view" components which allow you to create custom layouts without extra PHP classes.

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\View;

View::make('filament.forms.components.wizard')
```

This assumes that you have a `resources/views/filament/forms/components/wizard.blade.php` file.

## Custom layout classes

You may create your own custom component classes and views, which you can reuse across your project, and even release as a plugin to the community.

> If you're just creating a simple custom component to use once, you could instead use a [view component](#view-components) to render any custom Blade file.

To create a custom component class and view, you may use the following command:

```bash
php artisan make:form-layout Wizard
```

This will create the following layout component class:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Component;

class Wizard extends Component
{
    protected string $view = 'filament.forms.components.wizard';

    public static function make(): static
    {
        return app(static::class);
    }
}
```

It will also create a view file at `resources/views/filament/forms/components/wizard.blade.php`.

## Rendering the component's schema

Inside your view, you may render the component's `schema()` using the `$getChildComponentContainer()` function:

```blade
<div>
    {{ $getChildComponentContainer() }}
</div>
```

## Accessing the Eloquent record

Inside your view, you may access the Eloquent record using the `$getRecord()` function:

```blade
<div>
    {{ $getRecord()->name }}
</div>
```

# Documentation for forms. File: 04-layout/08-placeholder.md
---
title: Placeholder
---
import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"

## Overview

Placeholders can be used to render text-only "fields" within your forms. Each placeholder has `content()`, which cannot be changed by the user.

```php
use App\Models\Post;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Placeholder;

Placeholder::make('created')
    ->content(fn (Post $record): string => $record->created_at->toFormattedDateString())
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/layout/placeholder/simple" alt="Placeholder" version="3.x" />

> **Important:** All form fields require a unique name. That also applies to Placeholders!

## Rendering HTML inside the placeholder

You may even render custom HTML within placeholder content:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Placeholder;
use Illuminate\Support\HtmlString;

Placeholder::make('documentation')
    ->content(new HtmlString('<a href="https://filamentphp.com/docs">filamentphp.com</a>'))
```

## Dynamically generating placeholder content

By passing a closure to the `content()` method, you may dynamically generate placeholder content. You have access to any closure parameter explained in the [advanced closure customization](../advanced#closure-customization) documentation:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Placeholder;
use Filament\Forms\Get;

Placeholder::make('total')
    ->content(function (Get $get): string {
        return '€' . number_format($get('cost') * $get('quantity'), 2);
    })
```

# Documentation for forms. File: 05-validation.md
---
title: Validation
---

## Overview

Validation rules may be added to any [field](fields/getting-started).

In Laravel, validation rules are usually defined in arrays like `['required', 'max:255']` or a combined string like `required|max:255`. This is fine if you're exclusively working in the backend with simple form requests. But Filament is also able to give your users frontend validation, so they can fix their mistakes before any backend requests are made.

Filament includes several [dedicated validation methods](#available-rules), but you can also use any [other Laravel validation rules](#other-rules), including [custom validation rules](#custom-rules).

> Beware that some validations rely on the field name and therefore won't work when passed via `->rule()`/`->rules()`. Use the dedicated validation methods whenever you can.

## Available rules

### Active URL

The field must have a valid A or AAAA record according to the `dns_get_record()` PHP function. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-active-url)

```php
Field::make('name')->activeUrl()
```

### After (date)

The field value must be a value after a given date. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-after)

```php
Field::make('start_date')->after('tomorrow')
```

Alternatively, you may pass the name of another field to compare against:

```php
Field::make('start_date')
Field::make('end_date')->after('start_date')
```

### After or equal to (date)

The field value must be a date after or equal to the given date. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-after-or-equal)

```php
Field::make('start_date')->afterOrEqual('tomorrow')
```

Alternatively, you may pass the name of another field to compare against:

```php
Field::make('start_date')
Field::make('end_date')->afterOrEqual('start_date')
```

### Alpha

The field must be entirely alphabetic characters. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-alpha)

```php
Field::make('name')->alpha()
```

### Alpha Dash

The field may have alphanumeric characters, as well as dashes and underscores. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-alpha-dash)

```php
Field::make('name')->alphaDash()
```

### Alpha Numeric

The field must be entirely alphanumeric characters. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-alpha-num)

```php

By default, the form's model will be searched, [if it is registered](adding-a-form-to-a-livewire-component#setting-a-form-model). You may specify a custom table name or model to search:

```php
use App\Models\Invitation;

Field::make('invitation')->exists(table: Invitation::class)
```

By default, the field name will be used as the column to search. You may specify a custom column to search:

```php
Field::make('invitation')->exists(column: 'id')
```

You can further customize the rule by passing a [closure](advanced#closure-customization) to the `callback` parameter:

```php
use Illuminate\Validation\Rules\Exists;

```php
Field::make('name')->required()
```

### Required If

The field value must not be empty _only if_ the other specified field has any of the given values. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-required-if)

```php
Field::make('name')->requiredIf('field', 'value')
```

### Required If Accepted

The field value must not be empty _only if_ the other specified field is equal to "yes", "on", 1, "1", true, or "true". [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-required-if-accepted)

```php
Field::make('name')->requiredIfAccepted('field')
```

### Required Unless

The field value must not be empty _unless_ the other specified field has any of the given values. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-required-unless)

```php
Field::make('name')->requiredUnless('field', 'value')
```

### Required With

The field value must not be empty _only if_ any of the other specified fields are not empty. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-required-with)

```php
Field::make('name')->requiredWith('field,another_field')
```

### Required With All

The field value must not be empty _only if_ all the other specified fields are not empty. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-required-with-all)

```php
Field::make('name')->requiredWithAll('field,another_field')
```

### Required Without

The field value must not be empty _only when_ any of the other specified fields are empty. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-required-without)

```php
Field::make('name')->requiredWithout('field,another_field')
```

### Required Without All

The field value must not be empty _only when_ all the other specified fields are empty. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-required-without-all)

```php
Field::make('name')->requiredWithoutAll('field,another_field')
```

### Regex

The field must match the given regular expression. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-regex)

```php
Field::make('email')->regex('/^.+@.+$/i')
```

### Same

The field value must be the same as another. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-same)

```php
Field::make('password')->same('passwordConfirmation')
```

### Starts With

The field must start with one of the given values. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-starts-with)

```php
Field::make('name')->startsWith(['a'])
```

### String

The field must be a string. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-string)
```php
Field::make('name')->string()
```

### Unique

The field value must not exist in the database. [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-unique)

```php
Field::make('email')->unique()
```

By default, the form's model will be searched, [if it is registered](adding-a-form-to-a-livewire-component#setting-a-form-model). You may specify a custom table name or model to search:

```php
use App\Models\User;

Field::make('email')->unique(table: User::class)
```

By default, the field name will be used as the column to search. You may specify a custom column to search:

```php
Field::make('email')->unique(column: 'email_address')
```

Sometimes, you may wish to ignore a given model during unique validation. For example, consider an "update profile" form that includes the user's name, email address, and location. You will probably want to verify that the email address is unique. However, if the user only changes the name field and not the email field, you do not want a validation error to be thrown because the user is already the owner of the email address in question.

```php
Field::make('email')->unique(ignorable: $ignoredUser)
```

If you're using the [Panel Builder](../panels), you can easily ignore the current record by using `ignoreRecord` instead:

```php
Field::make('email')->unique(ignoreRecord: true)
```

You can further customize the rule by passing a [closure](advanced#closure-customization) to the `modifyRuleUsing` parameter:

```php
use Illuminate\Validation\Rules\Unique;

Field::make('email')
    ->unique(modifyRuleUsing: function (Unique $rule) {
        return $rule->where('is_active', 1);
    })
```


### ULID

The field under validation must be a valid [Universally Unique Lexicographically Sortable Identifier](https://github.com/ulid/spec) (ULID). [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-ulid)

```php
Field::make('identifier')->ulid()
```

### UUID

The field must be a valid RFC 4122 (version 1, 3, 4, or 5) universally unique identifier (UUID). [See the Laravel documentation.](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#rule-uuid)

```php
Field::make('identifier')->uuid()
```

## Other rules

You may add other validation rules to any field using the `rules()` method:

```php
TextInput::make('slug')->rules(['alpha_dash'])
```

A full list of validation rules may be found in the [Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#available-validation-rules).

## Custom rules

You may use any custom validation rules as you would do in [Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#custom-validation-rules):

```php
TextInput::make('slug')->rules([new Uppercase()])
```

You may also use [closure rules](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#using-closures):

```php
use Closure;

TextInput::make('slug')->rules([
    fn (): Closure => function (string $attribute, $value, Closure $fail) {
        if ($value === 'foo') {
            $fail('The :attribute is invalid.');
        }
    },
])
```

You may [inject utilities](advanced#form-component-utility-injection) like [`$get`](advanced#injecting-the-state-of-another-field) into your custom rules, for example if you need to reference other field values in your form:

```php
use Closure;
use Filament\Forms\Get;

TextInput::make('slug')->rules([
    fn (Get $get): Closure => function (string $attribute, $value, Closure $fail) use ($get) {
        if ($get('other_field') === 'foo' && $value !== 'bar') {
            $fail("The {$attribute} is invalid.");
        }
    },
])
```

## Customizing validation attributes

When fields fail validation, their label is used in the error message. To customize the label used in field error messages, use the `validationAttribute()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('name')->validationAttribute('full name')
```

## Validation messages

By default Laravel's validation error message is used. To customize the error messages, use the `validationMessages()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('email')
    ->unique(// ...)
    ->validationMessages([
        'unique' => 'The :attribute has already been registered.',
    ])
```

## Sending validation notifications

If you want to send a notification when validation error occurs, you may do so by using the `onValidationError()` method on your Livewire component:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;
use Illuminate\Validation\ValidationException;

protected function onValidationError(ValidationException $exception): void
{
    Notification::make()
        ->title($exception->getMessage())
        ->danger()
        ->send();
}
```

Alternatively, if you are using the Panel Builder and want this behavior on all the pages, add this inside the `boot()` method of your `AppServiceProvider`:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;
use Filament\Pages\Page;
use Illuminate\Validation\ValidationException;

Page::$reportValidationErrorUsing = function (ValidationException $exception) {
    Notification::make()
        ->title($exception->getMessage())
        ->danger()
        ->send();
};
```

import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"

## Overview

Filament's forms can use [Actions](../actions). They are buttons that can be added to any form component. For instance, you may want an action to call an API endpoint to generate content with AI, or to create a new option for a select dropdown. Also, you can [render anonymous sets of actions](#adding-anonymous-actions-to-a-form-without-attaching-them-to-a-component) on their own which are not attached to a particular form component.

## Defining a form component action

Action objects inside a form component are instances of `Filament/Forms/Components/Actions/Action`. You must pass a unique name to the action's `make()` method, which is used to identify it amongst others internally within Filament. You can [customize the trigger button](../actions/trigger-button) of an action, and even [open a modal](../actions/modals) with little effort:

```php
use App\Actions\ResetStars;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Actions\Action;

Action::make('resetStars')
    ->icon('heroicon-m-x-mark')
    ->color('danger')
    ->requiresConfirmation()
    ->action(function (ResetStars $resetStars) {
        $resetStars();
    })
```

### Adding an affix action to a field

Certain fields support "affix actions", which are buttons that can be placed before or after its input area. The following fields support affix actions:

- [Text input](fields/text-input)
- [Select](fields/select)
- [Date-time picker](fields/date-time-picker)
- [Color picker](fields/color-picker)

To define an affix action, you can pass it to either `prefixAction()` or `suffixAction()`:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Forms\Set;

TextInput::make('cost')
    ->prefix('€')
    ->suffixAction(
        Action::make('copyCostToPrice')
            ->icon('heroicon-m-clipboard')
            ->requiresConfirmation()
            ->action(function (Set $set, $state) {
                $set('price', $state);
            })
    )
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/actions/suffix" alt="Text input with suffix action" version="3.x" />

Notice `$set` and `$state` injected into the `action()` function in this example. This is [form component action utility injection](#form-component-action-utility-injection).

#### Passing multiple affix actions to a field

You may pass multiple affix actions to a field by passing them in an array to either `prefixActions()` or `suffixActions()`. Either method can be used, or both at once, Filament will render all the registered actions in order:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('cost')
    ->prefix('€')
    ->prefixActions([
        Action::make('...'),
        Action::make('...'),
        Action::make('...'),
    ])
    ->suffixActions([
        Action::make('...'),
        Action::make('...'),
    ])
```

### Adding a hint action to a field

All fields support "hint actions", which are rendered aside the field's [hint](fields/getting-started#adding-a-hint-next-to-the-label). To add a hint action to a field, you may pass it to `hintAction()`:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Forms\Set;

TextInput::make('cost')
    ->prefix('€')
    ->hintAction(
        Action::make('copyCostToPrice')
            ->icon('heroicon-m-clipboard')
            ->requiresConfirmation()
            ->action(function (Set $set, $state) {
                $set('price', $state);
            })
    )
```

Notice `$set` and `$state` injected into the `action()` function in this example. This is [form component action utility injection](#form-component-action-utility-injection).

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/fields/actions/hint" alt="Text input with hint action" version="3.x" />

#### Passing multiple hint actions to a field

You may pass multiple hint actions to a field by passing them in an array to `hintActions()`. Filament will render all the registered actions in order:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('cost')
    ->prefix('€')
    ->hintActions([
        Action::make('...'),
        Action::make('...'),
        Action::make('...'),
    ])
```

### Adding an action to a custom form component

If you wish to render an action within a custom form component, `ViewField` object, or `View` component object, you may do so using the `registerActions()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Forms\Components\ViewField;
use Filament\Forms\Set;

ViewField::make('rating')
    ->view('filament.forms.components.range-slider')
    ->registerActions([
        Action::make('setMaximum')
            ->icon('heroicon-m-star')
            ->action(function (Set $set) {
                $set('rating', 5);
            }),
    ])
```

Notice `$set` injected into the `action()` function in this example. This is [form component action utility injection](#form-component-action-utility-injection).

Now, to render the action in the view of the custom component, you need to call `$getAction()`, passing the name of the action you registered:

```blade
<div x-data="{ state: $wire.$entangle('{{ $getStatePath() }}') }">
    <input x-model="state" type="range" />
    
    {{ $getAction('setMaximum') }}
</div>
```

### Adding "anonymous" actions to a form without attaching them to a component

You may use an `Actions` component to render a set of actions anywhere in the form, avoiding the need to register them to any particular component:

```php
use App\Actions\Star;
use App\Actions\ResetStars;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Actions;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Actions\Action;

Actions::make([
    Action::make('star')
        ->icon('heroicon-m-star')
        ->requiresConfirmation()
        ->action(function (Star $star) {
            $star();
        }),
    Action::make('resetStars')
        ->icon('heroicon-m-x-mark')
        ->color('danger')
        ->requiresConfirmation()
        ->action(function (ResetStars $resetStars) {
            $resetStars();
        }),
]),
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/layout/actions/anonymous/simple" alt="Anonymous actions" version="3.x" />

#### Making the independent form actions consume the full width of the form

You can stretch the independent form actions to consume the full width of the form using `fullWidth()`:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Actions;

Actions::make([
    // ...
])->fullWidth(),
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/layout/actions/anonymous/full-width" alt="Anonymous actions consuming the full width" version="3.x" />

#### Controlling the horizontal alignment of independent form actions

Independent form actions are aligned to the start of the component by default. You may change this by passing `Alignment::Center` or `Alignment::End` to `alignment()`:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Actions;
use Filament\Support\Enums\Alignment;

Actions::make([
    // ...
])->alignment(Alignment::Center),
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/layout/actions/anonymous/horizontally-aligned-center" alt="Anonymous actions horizontally aligned to the center" version="3.x" />

#### Controlling the vertical alignment of independent form actions

Independent form actions are vertically aligned to the start of the component by default. You may change this by passing `Alignment::Center` or `Alignment::End` to `verticalAlignment()`:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Actions;
use Filament\Support\Enums\VerticalAlignment;

Actions::make([
    // ...
])->verticalAlignment(VerticalAlignment::End),
```

<AutoScreenshot name="forms/layout/actions/anonymous/vertically-aligned-end" alt="Anonymous actions vertically aligned to the end" version="3.x" />

## Form component action utility injection

If an action is attached to a form component, the `action()` function is able to [inject utilities](advanced#form-component-utility-injection) directly from that form component. For instance, you can inject [`$set`](advanced#injecting-a-function-to-set-the-state-of-another-field) and [`$state`](advanced#injecting-the-current-state-of-a-field):

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Forms\Set;

Action::make('copyCostToPrice')
    ->icon('heroicon-m-clipboard')
    ->requiresConfirmation()
    ->action(function (Set $set, $state) {
        $set('price', $state);
    })
```

Form component actions also have access to [all utilities that apply to actions](../actions/advanced#action-utility-injection) in general.

# Documentation for forms. File: 07-advanced.md

## Overview

Filament Form Builder is designed to be flexible and customizable. Many existing form builders allow users to define a form schema, but don't provide a great interface for defining inter-field interactions, or custom logic. Since all Filament forms are built on top of [Livewire](https://livewire.laravel.com), the form can adapt dynamically to user input, even after it has been initially rendered. Developers can use [parameter injection](#form-component-utility-injection) to access many utilities in real time and build dynamic forms based on user input. The [lifecycle](#field-lifecycle) of fields is open to extension using hook functions to define custom functionality for each field. This allows developers to build complex forms with ease.

## The basics of reactivity

[Livewire](https://livewire.laravel.com) is a tool that allows Blade-rendered HTML to dynamically re-render without requiring a full page reload. Filament forms are built on top of Livewire, so they are able to re-render dynamically, allowing their layout to adapt after they are initially rendered.

By default, when a user uses a field, the form will not re-render. Since rendering requires a round-trip to the server, this is a performance optimization. However, if you wish to re-render the form after the user has interacted with a field, you can use the `live()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('status')
    ->options([
        'draft' => 'Draft',
        'reviewing' => 'Reviewing',
        'published' => 'Published',
    ])
    ->live()
```

In this example, when the user changes the value of the `status` field, the form will re-render. This allows you to then make changes to fields in the form based on the new value of the `status` field. Also, you can [hook in to the field's lifecycle](#field-updates) to perform custom logic when the field is updated.

### Reactive fields on blur

By default, when a field is set to `live()`, the form will re-render every time the field is interacted with. However, this may not be appropriate for some fields like the text input, since making network requests while the user is still typing results in suboptimal performance. You may wish to re-render the form only after the user has finished using the field, when it becomes out of focus. You can do this using the `live(onBlur: true)` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('username')
    ->live(onBlur: true)
```

### Debouncing reactive fields

You may wish to find a middle ground between `live()` and `live(onBlur: true)`, using "debouncing". Debouncing will prevent a network request from being sent until a user has finished typing for a certain period of time. You can do this using the `live(debounce: 500)` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('username')
    ->live(debounce: 500) // Wait 500ms before re-rendering the form.
```

In this example, `500` is the number of milliseconds to wait before sending a network request. You can customize this number to whatever you want, or even use a string like `'1s'`.

The vast majority of methods used to configure [fields](fields/getting-started) and [layout components](layout/getting-started) accept functions as parameters instead of hardcoded values:

```php
use App\Models\User;
use Filament\Forms\Components\DatePicker;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

DatePicker::make('date_of_birth')
    ->displayFormat(function (): string {
        if (auth()->user()->country_id === 'us') {
            return 'm/d/Y';
        }

        return 'd/m/Y';
    })

Select::make('user_id')
    ->options(function (): array {
        return User::all()->pluck('name', 'id')->all();
    })

TextInput::make('middle_name')
    ->required(fn (): bool => auth()->user()->hasMiddleName())
```

This alone unlocks many customization possibilities.

The package is also able to inject many utilities to use inside these functions, as parameters. All customization methods that accept functions as arguments can inject utilities.

These injected utilities require specific parameter names to be used. Otherwise, Filament doesn't know what to inject.

### Injecting the current state of a field

If you wish to access the current state (value) of the field, define a `$state` parameter:

```php
function ($state) {
    // ...
}
```

### Injecting the current form component instance

If you wish to access the current component instance, define a `$component` parameter:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Component;

function (Component $component) {
    // ...
}
```

### Injecting the current Livewire component instance

If you wish to access the current Livewire component instance, define a `$livewire` parameter:

```php
use Livewire\Component as Livewire;

function (Livewire $livewire) {
    // ...
}
```

### Injecting the current form record

If your form is associated with an Eloquent model instance, define a `$record` parameter:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

function (?Model $record) {
    // ...
}
```

### Injecting the state of another field

You may also retrieve the state (value) of another field from within a callback, using a `$get` parameter:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Get;

function (Get $get) {
    $email = $get('email'); // Store the value of the `email` field in the `$email` variable.
    //...
}
```

### Injecting a function to set the state of another field

In a similar way to `$get`, you may also set the value of another field from within a callback, using a `$set` parameter:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Set;

function (Set $set) {
    $set('title', 'Blog Post'); // Set the `title` field to `Blog Post`.
    //...
}
```

When this function is run, the state of the `title` field will be updated, and the form will re-render with the new title. This is useful inside the [`afterStateUpdated`](#field-updates) method.

### Injecting the current form operation

If you're writing a form for a panel resource or relation manager, and you wish to check if a form is `create`, `edit` or `view`, use the `$operation` parameter:

```php
function (string $operation) {
    // ...
}
```

> Outside the panel, you can set a form's operation by using the `operation()` method on the form definition.

### Injecting multiple utilities

The parameters are injected dynamically using reflection, so you are able to combine multiple parameters in any order:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Get;
use Filament\Forms\Set;
use Livewire\Component as Livewire;

function (Livewire $livewire, Get $get, Set $set) {
    // ...
}
```

### Injecting dependencies from Laravel's container

You may inject anything from Laravel's container like normal, alongside utilities:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Set;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

function (Request $request, Set $set) {
    // ...
}
```

## Field lifecycle

Each field in a form has a lifecycle, which is the process it goes through when the form is loaded, when it is interacted with by the user, and when it is submitted. You may customize what happens at each stage of this lifecycle using a function that gets run at that stage.

### Field hydration

Hydration is the process that fills fields with data. It runs when you call the form's `fill()` method. You may customize what happens after a field is hydrated using the `afterStateHydrated()` method.

In this example, the `name` field will always be hydrated with the correctly capitalized name:

```php
use Closure;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->required()
    ->afterStateHydrated(function (TextInput $component, string $state) {
        $component->state(ucwords($state));
    })
```

As a shortcut for formatting the field's state like this when it is hydrated, you can use the `formatStateUsing()` method:

```php
use Closure;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->formatStateUsing(fn (string $state): string => ucwords($state))
```

### Field updates

You may use the `afterStateUpdated()` method to customize what happens after a field is updated by the user. Only changes from the user on the frontend will trigger this function, not manual changes to the state from `$set()` or another PHP function.

Inside this function, you can also inject the `$old` value of the field before it was updated, using the `$old` parameter:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->afterStateUpdated(function (?string $state, ?string $old) {
        // ...
    })
```

For an example of how to use this method, learn how to [automatically generate a slug from a title](#generating-a-slug-from-a-title).

### Field dehydration

Dehydration is the process that gets data from the fields in your forms, and transforms it. It runs when you call the form's `getState()` method.

You may customize how the state is transformed when it is dehydrated using the `dehydrateStateUsing()` function. In this example, the `name` field will always be dehydrated with the correctly capitalized name:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('name')
    ->required()
    ->dehydrateStateUsing(fn (string $state): string => ucwords($state))
```

#### Preventing a field from being dehydrated

You may also prevent a field from being dehydrated altogether using `dehydrated(false)`. In this example, the field will not be present in the array returned from `getState()`:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('password_confirmation')
    ->password()
    ->dehydrated(false)
```

If your form auto-saves data to the database, like in a [resource](../panels/resources/getting-started) or [table action](../tables/actions), this is useful to prevent a field from being saved to the database if it is purely used for presentational purposes.

## Reactive forms cookbook

This section contains a collection of recipes for common tasks you may need to perform when building an advanced form.

### Conditionally hiding a field

To conditionally hide or show a field, you can pass a function to the `hidden()` method, and return `true` or `false` depending on whether you want the field to be hidden or not. The function can [inject utilities](#form-component-utility-injection) as parameters, so you can do things like check the value of another field:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Get;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Checkbox;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

Checkbox::make('is_company')
    ->live()

TextInput::make('company_name')
    ->hidden(fn (Get $get): bool => ! $get('is_company'))
```

In this example, the `is_company` checkbox is [`live()`](#the-basics-of-reactivity). This allows the form to rerender when the value of the `is_company` field changes. You can access the value of that field from within the `hidden()` function using the [`$get()` utility](#injecting-the-current-state-of-a-field). The value of the field is inverted using `!` so that the `company_name` field is hidden when the `is_company` field is `false`.

Alternatively, you can use the `visible()` method to show a field conditionally. It does the exact inverse of `hidden()`, and could be used if you prefer the clarity of the code when written this way:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Get;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Checkbox;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

Checkbox::make('is_company')
    ->live()
    
TextInput::make('company_name')
    ->visible(fn (Get $get): bool => $get('is_company'))
```

### Conditionally making a field required

To conditionally make a field required, you can pass a function to the `required()` method, and return `true` or `false` depending on whether you want the field to be required or not. The function can [inject utilities](#form-component-utility-injection) as parameters, so you can do things like check the value of another field:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Get;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('company_name')
    ->live(onBlur: true)
    
TextInput::make('vat_number')
    ->required(fn (Get $get): bool => filled($get('company_name')))
```

In this example, the `company_name` field is [`live(onBlur: true)`](#reactive-fields-on-blur). This allows the form to rerender after the value of the `company_name` field changes and the user clicks away. You can access the value of that field from within the `required()` function using the [`$get()` utility](#injecting-the-current-state-of-a-field). The value of the field is checked using `filled()` so that the `vat_number` field is required when the `company_name` field is not `null` or an empty string. The result is that the `vat_number` field is only required when the `company_name` field is filled in.

Using a function is able to make any other [validation rule](validation) dynamic in a similar way.

### Generating a slug from a title

To generate a slug from a title while the user is typing, you can use the [`afterStateUpdated()` method](#field-updates) on the title field to [`$set()`](#injecting-a-function-to-set-the-state-of-another-field) the value of the slug field:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Forms\Set;
use Illuminate\Support\Str;

TextInput::make('title')
    ->live(onBlur: true)
    ->afterStateUpdated(fn (Set $set, ?string $state) => $set('slug', Str::slug($state)))
    
TextInput::make('slug')
```

In this example, the `title` field is [`live(onBlur: true)`](#reactive-fields-on-blur). This allows the form to rerender when the value of the `title` field changes and the user clicks away. The `afterStateUpdated()` method is used to run a function after the state of the `title` field is updated. The function injects the [`$set()` utility](#injecting-a-function-to-set-the-state-of-another-field) and the new state of the `title` field. The `Str::slug()` utility method is part of Laravel and is used to generate a slug from a string. The `slug` field is then updated using the `$set()` function.

One thing to note is that the user may customize the slug manually, and we don't want to overwrite their changes if the title changes. To prevent this, we can use the old version of the title to work out if the user has modified it themselves. To access the old version of the title, you can inject `$old`, and to get the current value of the slug before it gets changed, we can use the [`$get()` utility](#injecting-the-state-of-another-field):

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Forms\Get;
use Filament\Forms\Set;
use Illuminate\Support\Str;

TextInput::make('title')
    ->live(onBlur: true)
    ->afterStateUpdated(function (Get $get, Set $set, ?string $old, ?string $state) {
        if (($get('slug') ?? '') !== Str::slug($old)) {
            return;
        }
    
        $set('slug', Str::slug($state));
    })
    
TextInput::make('slug')
```

### Dependant select options

To dynamically update the options of a [select field](fields/select) based on the value of another field, you can pass a function to the `options()` method of the select field. The function can [inject utilities](#form-component-utility-injection) as parameters, so you can do things like check the value of another field using the [`$get()` utility](#injecting-the-current-state-of-a-field):

```php
use Filament\Forms\Get;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('category')
    ->options([
        'web' => 'Web development',
        'mobile' => 'Mobile development',
        'design' => 'Design',
    ])
    ->live()

Select::make('sub_category')
    ->options(fn (Get $get): array => match ($get('category')) {
        'web' => [
            'frontend_web' => 'Frontend development',
            'backend_web' => 'Backend development',
        ],
        'mobile' => [
            'ios_mobile' => 'iOS development',
            'android_mobile' => 'Android development',
        ],
        'design' => [
            'app_design' => 'Panel design',
            'marketing_website_design' => 'Marketing website design',
        ],
        default => [],
    })
```

In this example, the `category` field is [`live()`](#the-basics-of-reactivity). This allows the form to rerender when the value of the `category` field changes. You can access the value of that field from within the `options()` function using the [`$get()` utility](#injecting-the-current-state-of-a-field). The value of the field is used to determine which options should be available in the `sub_category` field. The `match ()` statement in PHP is used to return an array of options based on the value of the `category` field. The result is that the `sub_category` field will only show options relevant to the selected `category` field.

You could adapt this example to use options loaded from an Eloquent model or other data source, by querying within the function:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Get;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;
use Illuminate\Support\Collection;

Select::make('category')
    ->options(Category::query()->pluck('name', 'id'))
    ->live()
    
Select::make('sub_category')
    ->options(fn (Get $get): Collection => SubCategory::query()
        ->where('category', $get('category'))
        ->pluck('name', 'id'))
```

### Dynamic fields based on a select option

You may wish to render a different set of fields based on the value of a field, like a select. To do this, you can pass a function to the `schema()` method of any [layout component](layout/getting-started), which checks the value of the field and returns a different schema based on that value. Also, you will need a way to initialise the new fields in the dynamic schema when they are first loaded.

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Grid;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Forms\Get;

Select::make('type')
    ->options([
        'employee' => 'Employee',
        'freelancer' => 'Freelancer',
    ])
    ->live()
    ->afterStateUpdated(fn (Select $component) => $component
        ->getContainer()
        ->getComponent('dynamicTypeFields')
        ->getChildComponentContainer()
        ->fill())
    
Grid::make(2)
    ->schema(fn (Get $get): array => match ($get('type')) {
        'employee' => [
            TextInput::make('employee_number')
                ->required(),
            FileUpload::make('badge')
                ->image()
                ->required(),
        ],
        'freelancer' => [
            TextInput::make('hourly_rate')
                ->numeric()
                ->required()
                ->prefix('€'),
            FileUpload::make('contract')
                ->required(),
        ],
        default => [],
    })
    ->key('dynamicTypeFields')
```

In this example, the `type` field is [`live()`](#the-basics-of-reactivity). This allows the form to rerender when the value of the `type` field changes. The `afterStateUpdated()` method is used to run a function after the state of the `type` field is updated. In this case, we [inject the current select field instance](#injecting-the-current-form-component-instance), which we can then use to get the form "container" instance that holds both the select and the grid components. With this container, we can target the grid component using a unique key (`dynamicTypeFields`) that we have assigned to it. With that grid component instance, we can call `fill()`, just as we do on a normal form to initialise it. The `schema()` method of the grid component is then used to return a different schema based on the value of the `type` field. This is done by using the [`$get()` utility](#injecting-the-current-state-of-a-field), and returning a different schema array dynamically.

### Auto-hashing password field

You have a password field:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

TextInput::make('password')
    ->password()
```

And you can use a [dehydration function](#field-dehydration) to hash the password when the form is submitted:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Hash;

TextInput::make('password')
    ->password()
    ->dehydrateStateUsing(fn (string $state): string => Hash::make($state))
```

But if your form is used to change an existing password, you don't want to overwrite the existing password if the field is empty. You can [prevent the field from being dehydrated](#preventing-a-field-from-being-dehydrated) if the field is null or an empty string (using the `filled()` helper):

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Hash;

TextInput::make('password')
    ->password()
    ->dehydrateStateUsing(fn (string $state): string => Hash::make($state))
    ->dehydrated(fn (?string $state): bool => filled($state))
```

However, you want to require the password to be filled when the user is being created, by [injecting the `$operation` utility](#injecting-the-current-form-operation), and then [conditionally making the field required](#conditionally-making-a-field-required):

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Hash;

TextInput::make('password')
    ->password()
    ->dehydrateStateUsing(fn (string $state): string => Hash::make($state))
    ->dehydrated(fn (?string $state): bool => filled($state))
    ->required(fn (string $operation): bool => $operation === 'create')
```

## Saving data to relationships

> If you're building a form inside your Livewire component, make sure you have set up the [form's model](adding-a-form-to-a-livewire-component#setting-a-form-model). Otherwise, Filament doesn't know which model to use to retrieve the relationship from.

As well as being able to give structure to fields, [layout components](layout/getting-started) are also able to "teleport" their nested fields into a relationship. Filament will handle loading data from a `HasOne`, `BelongsTo` or `MorphOne` Eloquent relationship, and then it will save the data back to the same relationship. To set this behavior up, you can use the `relationship()` method on any layout component:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Fieldset;
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Textarea;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

Fieldset::make('Metadata')
    ->relationship('metadata')
    ->schema([
        TextInput::make('title'),
        Textarea::make('description'),
        FileUpload::make('image'),
    ])
```

In this example, the `title`, `description` and `image` are automatically loaded from the `metadata` relationship, and saved again when the form is submitted. If the `metadata` record does not exist, it is automatically created.

This functionality is not just limited to fieldsets - you can use it with any layout component. For example, you could use a `Group` component which has no styling associated with it:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Group;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

Group::make()
    ->relationship('customer')
    ->schema([
        TextInput::make('name')
            ->label('Customer')
            ->required(),
        TextInput::make('email')
            ->label('Email address')
            ->email()
            ->required(),
    ])
```

### Saving data to a `BelongsTo` relationship

Please note that if you are saving the data to a `BelongsTo` relationship, then the foreign key column in your database must be `nullable()`. This is because Filament saves the form first, before saving the relationship. Since the form is saved first, the foreign ID does not exist yet, so it must be nullable. Immediately after the form is saved, Filament saves the relationship, which will then fill in the foreign ID and save it again.

It is worth noting that if you have an observer on your form model, then you may need to adapt it to ensure that it does not depend on the relationship existing when it it created. For example, if you have an observer that sends an email to a related record when a form is created, you may need to switch to using a different hook that runs after the relationship is attached, like `updated()`.

### Conditionally saving data to a relationship

Sometimes, saving the related record may be optional. If the user fills out the customer fields, then the customer will be created / updated. Otherwise, the customer will not be created, or will be deleted if it already exists. To do this, you can pass a `condition` function as an argument to `relationship()`, which can use the `$state` of the related form to determine whether the relationship should be saved or not:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Group;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

Group::make()
    ->relationship(
        'customer',
        condition: fn (?array $state): bool => filled($state['name']),
    )
    ->schema([
        TextInput::make('name')
            ->label('Customer'),
        TextInput::make('email')
            ->label('Email address')
            ->email()
            ->requiredWith('name'),
    ])
```

In this example, the customer's name is not `required()`, and the email address is only required when the `name` is filled. The `condition` function is used to check whether the `name` field is filled, and if it is, then the customer will be created / updated. Otherwise, the customer will not be created, or will be deleted if it already exists.

## Inserting Livewire components into a form

You may insert a Livewire component directly into a form:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Livewire;
use App\Livewire\Foo;

Livewire::make(Foo::class)
```

If you are rendering multiple of the same Livewire component, please make sure to pass a unique `key()` to each:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Livewire;
use App\Livewire\Foo;

Livewire::make(Foo::class)
    ->key('foo-first')

Livewire::make(Foo::class)
    ->key('foo-second')

Livewire::make(Foo::class)
    ->key('foo-third')
```

### Passing parameters to a Livewire component

You can pass an array of parameters to a Livewire component:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Livewire;
use App\Livewire\Foo;

Livewire::make(Foo::class, ['bar' => 'baz'])
```

Now, those parameters will be passed to the Livewire component's `mount()` method:

```php
class Foo extends Component
{
    public function mount(string $bar): void
    {       
        // ...
    }
}
```

Alternatively, they will be available as public properties on the Livewire component:

```php
class Foo extends Component
{
    public string $bar;
}
```

#### Accessing the current record in the Livewire component

You can access the current record in the Livewire component using the `$record` parameter in the `mount()` method, or the `$record` property:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Foo extends Component
{
    public function mount(?Model $record = null): void
    {       
        // ...
    }
    
    // or
    
    public ?Model $record = null;
}
```

Please be aware that when the record has not yet been created, it will be `null`. If you'd like to hide the Livewire component when the record is `null`, you can use the `hidden()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Livewire;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

Livewire::make(Foo::class)
    ->hidden(fn (?Model $record): bool => $record === null)
```

### Lazy loading a Livewire component

You may allow the component to [lazily load](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/lazy#rendering-placeholder-html) using the `lazy()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Livewire;
use App\Livewire\Foo;

Livewire::make(Foo::class)->lazy()       
```

# Documentation for forms. File: 08-adding-a-form-to-a-livewire-component.md
---
title: Adding a form to a Livewire component
---

## Setting up the Livewire component

First, generate a new Livewire component:

```bash
php artisan make:livewire CreatePost
```

Then, render your Livewire component on the page:

```blade
@livewire('create-post')
```

Alternatively, you can use a full-page Livewire component:

```php
use App\Livewire\CreatePost;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

Route::get('posts/create', CreatePost::class);
```

## Adding the form

There are 5 main tasks when adding a form to a Livewire component class. Each one is essential:

1) Implement the `HasForms` interface and use the `InteractsWithForms` trait.
2) Define a public Livewire property to store your form's data. In our example, we'll call this `$data`, but you can call it whatever you want.
3) Add a `form()` method, which is where you configure the form. [Add the form's schema](getting-started#form-schemas), and tell Filament to store the form data in the `$data` property (using `statePath('data')`).
4) Initialize the form with `$this->form->fill()` in `mount()`. This is imperative for every form that you build, even if it doesn't have any initial data.
5) Define a method to handle the form submission. In our example, we'll call this `create()`, but you can call it whatever you want. Inside that method, you can validate and get the form's data using `$this->form->getState()`. It's important that you use this method instead of accessing the `$this->data` property directly, because the form's data needs to be validated and transformed into a useful format before being returned.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Livewire;

use App\Models\Post;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Forms\Components\MarkdownEditor;
use Filament\Forms\Concerns\InteractsWithForms;
use Filament\Forms\Contracts\HasForms;
use Filament\Forms\Form;
use Illuminate\Contracts\View\View;
use Livewire\Component;

class CreatePost extends Component implements HasForms
{
    use InteractsWithForms;
    
    public ?array $data = [];
    
    public function mount(): void
    {
        $this->form->fill();
    }
    
    public function form(Form $form): Form
    {
        return $form
            ->schema([
                TextInput::make('title')
                    ->required(),
                MarkdownEditor::make('content'),
                // ...
            ])
            ->statePath('data');
    }
    
    public function create(): void
    {
        dd($this->form->getState());
    }
    
    public function render(): View
    {
        return view('livewire.create-post');
    }
}
```

Finally, in your Livewire component's view, render the form:

```blade
<div>
    <form wire:submit="create">
        {{ $this->form }}
        
        <button type="submit">
            Submit
        </button>
    </form>
    
    <x-filament-actions::modals />
</div>
```

> `<x-filament-actions::modals />` is used to render form component [action modals](actions). The code can be put anywhere outside the `<form>` element, as long as it's within the Livewire component.

Visit your Livewire component in the browser, and you should see the form components from `schema()`:

Submit the form with data, and you'll see the form's data dumped to the screen. You can save the data to a model instead of dumping it:

```php
use App\Models\Post;

public function create(): void
{
    Post::create($this->form->getState());
}
```

## Initializing the form with data

To fill the form with data, just pass that data to the `$this->form->fill()` method. For example, if you're editing an existing post, you might do something like this:

```php
use App\Models\Post;

public function mount(Post $post): void
{
    $this->form->fill($post->toArray());
}
```

It's important that you use the `$this->form->fill()` method instead of assigning the data directly to the `$this->data` property. This is because the post's data needs to be internally transformed into a useful format before being stored.

## Setting a form model

Giving the `$form` access to a model is useful for a few reasons:

- It allows fields within that form to load information from that model. For example, select fields can [load their options from the database](fields/select#integrating-with-an-eloquent-relationship) automatically.
- The form can load and save the model's relationship data automatically. For example, you have an Edit Post form, with a [Repeater](fields/repeater#integrating-with-an-eloquent-relationship) which manages comments associated with that post. Filament will automatically load the comments for that post when you call `$this->form->fill([...])`, and save them back to the relationship when you call `$this->form->getState()`.
- Validation rules like `exists()` and `unique()` can automatically retrieve the database table name from the model.

It is advised to always pass the model to the form when there is one. As explained, it unlocks many new powers of the Filament Form Builder.

To pass the model to the form, use the `$form->model()` method:

```php
use App\Models\Post;
use Filament\Forms\Form;

public Post $post;

public function form(Form $form): Form
{
    return $form
        ->schema([
            // ...
        ])
        ->statePath('data')
        ->model($this->post);
}
```

### Passing the form model after the form has been submitted

In some cases, the form's model is not available until the form has been submitted. For example, in a Create Post form, the post does not exist until the form has been submitted. Therefore, you can't pass it in to `$form->model()`. However, you can pass a model class instead:

```php
use App\Models\Post;
use Filament\Forms\Form;

public function form(Form $form): Form
{
    return $form
        ->schema([
            // ...
        ])
        ->statePath('data')
        ->model(Post::class);
}
```

On its own, this isn't as powerful as passing a model instance. For example, relationships won't be saved to the post after it is created. To do that, you'll need to pass the post to the form after it has been created, and call `saveRelationships()` to save the relationships to it:

```php
use App\Models\Post;

public function create(): void
{
    $post = Post::create($this->form->getState());
    
    // Save the relationships from the form to the post after it is created.
    $this->form->model($post)->saveRelationships();
}
```

## Saving form data to individual properties

In all of our previous examples, we've been saving the form's data to the public `$data` property on the Livewire component. However, you can save the data to individual properties instead. For example, if you have a form with a `title` field, you can save the form's data to the `$title` property instead. To do this, don't pass a `statePath()` to the form at all. Ensure that all of your fields have their own **public** properties on the class.

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Forms\Components\MarkdownEditor;
use Filament\Forms\Form;

public ?string $title = null;

public ?string $content = null;

public function form(Form $form): Form
{
    return $form
        ->schema([
            TextInput::make('title')
                ->required(),
            MarkdownEditor::make('content'),
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

## Using multiple forms

By default, the `InteractsWithForms` trait only handles one form per Livewire component - `form()`. To add more forms to the Livewire component, you can define them in the `getForms()` method, and return an array containing the name of each form:

```php
protected function getForms(): array
{
    return [
        'editPostForm',
        'createCommentForm',
    ];
}
```

Each of these forms can now be defined within the Livewire component, using a method with the same name:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Forms\Components\MarkdownEditor;
use Filament\Forms\Form;

public function editPostForm(Form $form): Form
{
    return $form
        ->schema([
            TextInput::make('title')
                ->required(),
            MarkdownEditor::make('content'),
            // ...
        ])
        ->statePath('postData')
        ->model($this->post);
}

public function createCommentForm(Form $form): Form
{
    return $form
        ->schema([
            TextInput::make('name')
                ->required(),
            TextInput::make('email')
                ->email()
                ->required(),
            MarkdownEditor::make('content')
                ->required(),
            // ...
        ])
        ->statePath('commentData')
        ->model(Comment::class);
}
```

Now, each form is addressable by its name instead of `form`. For example, to fill the post form, you can use `$this->editPostForm->fill([...])`, or to get the data from the comment form you can use `$this->createCommentForm->getState()`.

You'll notice that each form has its own unique `statePath()`. Each form will write its state to a different array on your Livewire component, so it's important to define these:

```php
public ?array $postData = [];
public ?array $commentData = [];
```

## Resetting a form's data

You can reset a form back to its default data at any time by calling `$this->form->fill()`. For example, you may wish to clear the contents of a form every time it's submitted:

```php
use App\Models\Comment;

public function createComment(): void
{
    Comment::create($this->form->getState());

    // Reinitialize the form to clear its data.
    $this->form->fill();
}
```

## Generating form Livewire components with the CLI

It's advised that you learn how to set up a Livewire component with the Form Builder manually, but once you are confident, you can use the CLI to generate a form for you.

```bash
php artisan make:livewire-form RegistrationForm
```

This will generate a new `app/Livewire/RegistrationForm.php` component, which you can customize.

### Generating a form for an Eloquent model

Filament is also able to generate forms for a specific Eloquent model. These are more powerful, as they will automatically save the data in the form for you, and [ensure the form fields are properly configured](#setting-a-form-model) to access that model.

When generating a form with the `make:livewire-form` command, it will ask for the name of the model:

```bash
php artisan make:livewire-form Products/CreateProduct
```

#### Generating an edit form for an Eloquent record

By default, passing a model to the `make:livewire-form` command will result in a form that creates a new record in your database. If you pass the `--edit` flag to the command, it will generate an edit form for a specific record. This will automatically fill the form with the data from the record, and save the data back to the model when the form is submitted.

```bash
php artisan make:livewire-form Products/EditProduct --edit
```

### Automatically generating form schemas

Filament is also able to guess which form fields you want in the schema, based on the model's database columns. You can use the `--generate` flag when generating your form:

```bash
php artisan make:livewire-form Products/CreateProduct --generate
```

# Documentation for forms. File: 09-testing.md

title: Testing
---

## Overview

All examples in this guide will be written using [Pest](https://pestphp.com). To use Pest's Livewire plugin for testing, you can follow the installation instructions in the Pest documentation on plugins: [Livewire plugin for Pest](https://pestphp.com/docs/plugins#livewire). However, you can easily adapt this to PHPUnit.

Since the Form Builder works on Livewire components, you can use the [Livewire testing helpers](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/testing). However, we have custom testing helpers that you can use with forms:

## Filling a form

To fill a form with data, pass the data to `fillForm()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

livewire(CreatePost::class)
    ->fillForm([
        'title' => fake()->sentence(),
        // ...
    ]);
```

> If you have multiple forms on a Livewire component, you can specify which form you want to fill using `fillForm([...], 'createPostForm')`.

To check that a form has data, use `assertFormSet()`:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Str;
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can automatically generate a slug from the title', function () {
    $title = fake()->sentence();

    livewire(CreatePost::class)
        ->fillForm([
            'title' => $title,
        ])
        ->assertFormSet([
            'slug' => Str::slug($title),
        ]);
});
```

> If you have multiple forms on a Livewire component, you can specify which form you want to check using `assertFormSet([...], 'createPostForm')`.

You may also find it useful to pass a function to the `assertFormSet()` method, which allows you to access the form `$state` and perform additional assertions:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Str;
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can automatically generate a slug from the title without any spaces', function () {
    $title = fake()->sentence();

    livewire(CreatePost::class)
        ->fillForm([
            'title' => $title,
        ])
        ->assertFormSet(function (array $state): array {
            expect($state['slug'])
                ->not->toContain(' ');
                
            return [
                'slug' => Str::slug($title),
            ];
        });
});
```

You can return an array from the function if you want Filament to continue to assert the form state after the function has been run.

## Validation

Use `assertHasFormErrors()` to ensure that data is properly validated in a form:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can validate input', function () {
    livewire(CreatePost::class)
        ->fillForm([
            'title' => null,
        ])
        ->call('create')
        ->assertHasFormErrors(['title' => 'required']);
});
```

And `assertHasNoFormErrors()` to ensure there are no validation errors:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

livewire(CreatePost::class)
    ->fillForm([
        'title' => fake()->sentence(),
        // ...
    ])
    ->call('create')
    ->assertHasNoFormErrors();
```

> If you have multiple forms on a Livewire component, you can pass the name of a specific form as the second parameter like `assertHasFormErrors(['title' => 'required'], 'createPostForm')` or `assertHasNoFormErrors([], 'createPostForm')`.

## Form existence

To check that a Livewire component has a form, use `assertFormExists()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('has a form', function () {
    livewire(CreatePost::class)
        ->assertFormExists();
});
```

> If you have multiple forms on a Livewire component, you can pass the name of a specific form like `assertFormExists('createPostForm')`.

## Fields

To ensure that a form has a given field, pass the field name to `assertFormFieldExists()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('has a title field', function () {
    livewire(CreatePost::class)
        ->assertFormFieldExists('title');
});
```

You may pass a function as an additional argument in order to assert that a field passes a given "truth test". This is useful for asserting that a field has a specific configuration:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('has a title field', function () {
    livewire(CreatePost::class)
        ->assertFormFieldExists('title', function (TextInput $field): bool {
            return $field->isDisabled();
        });
});
```

To assert that a form does not have a given field, pass the field name to `assertFormFieldDoesNotExist()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('does not have a conditional field', function () {
    livewire(CreatePost::class)
        ->assertFormFieldDoesNotExist('no-such-field');
});
```

> If you have multiple forms on a Livewire component, you can specify which form you want to check for the existence of the field like `assertFormFieldExists('title', 'createPostForm')`.

### Hidden fields

To ensure that a field is visible, pass the name to `assertFormFieldIsVisible()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

test('title is visible', function () {
    livewire(CreatePost::class)
        ->assertFormFieldIsVisible('title');
});
```

Or to ensure that a field is hidden you can pass the name to `assertFormFieldIsHidden()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

test('title is hidden', function () {
    livewire(CreatePost::class)
        ->assertFormFieldIsHidden('title');
});
```

> For both `assertFormFieldIsHidden()` and `assertFormFieldIsVisible()` you can pass the name of a specific form the field belongs to as the second argument like `assertFormFieldIsHidden('title', 'createPostForm')`.

### Disabled fields

To ensure that a field is enabled, pass the name to `assertFormFieldIsEnabled()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

test('title is enabled', function () {
    livewire(CreatePost::class)
        ->assertFormFieldIsEnabled('title');
});
```

Or to ensure that a field is disabled you can pass the name to `assertFormFieldIsDisabled()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

test('title is disabled', function () {
    livewire(CreatePost::class)
        ->assertFormFieldIsDisabled('title');
});
```

> For both `assertFormFieldIsEnabled()` and `assertFormFieldIsDisabled()` you can pass the name of a specific form the field belongs to as the second argument like `assertFormFieldIsEnabled('title', 'createPostForm')`.

## Layout components

If you need to check if a particular layout component exists rather than a field, you may use `assertFormComponentExists()`.  As layout components do not have names, this method uses the `key()` provided by the developer:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Section;

Section::make('Comments')
    ->key('comments-section')
    ->schema([
        //
    ])
```

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

test('comments section exists', function () {
    livewire(EditPost::class)
        ->assertFormComponentExists('comments-section');
});
```

To assert that a form does not have a given component, pass the component key to `assertFormComponentDoesNotExist()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('does not have a conditional component', function () {
    livewire(CreatePost::class)
        ->assertFormComponentDoesNotExist('no-such-section');
});
```

To check if the component exists and passes a given truth test, you can pass a function to the second argument of `assertFormComponentExists()`, returning true or false if the component passes the test or not:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Component;

use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

test('comments section has heading', function () {
    livewire(EditPost::class)
        ->assertFormComponentExists(
            'comments-section',
            function (Component $component): bool {
                return $component->getHeading() === 'Comments';
            },
        );
});
```

If you want more informative test results, you can embed an assertion within your truth test callback:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Component;
use Illuminate\Testing\Assert;

use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

test('comments section is enabled', function () {
    livewire(EditPost::class)
        ->assertFormComponentExists(
            'comments-section',
            function (Component $component): bool {
                Assert::assertTrue(
                    $component->isEnabled(),
                    'Failed asserting that comments-section is enabled.',
                );
                
                return true;
            },
        );
});
```

### Wizard

To go to a wizard's next step, use `goToNextWizardStep()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('moves to next wizard step', function () {
    livewire(CreatePost::class)
        ->goToNextWizardStep()
        ->assertHasFormErrors(['title']);
});
```

You can also go to the previous step by calling `goToPreviousWizardStep()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('moves to next wizard step', function () {
    livewire(CreatePost::class)
        ->goToPreviousWizardStep()
        ->assertHasFormErrors(['title']);
});
```

If you want to go to a specific step, use `goToWizardStep()`, then the `assertWizardCurrentStep` method which can ensure you are on the desired step without validation errors from the previous:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('moves to the wizards second step', function () {
    livewire(CreatePost::class)
        ->goToWizardStep(2)
        ->assertWizardCurrentStep(2);
});
```

If you have multiple forms on a single Livewire component, any of the wizard test helpers can accept a `formName` parameter:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('moves to next wizard step only for fooForm', function () {
    livewire(CreatePost::class)
        ->goToNextWizardStep(formName: 'fooForm')
        ->assertHasFormErrors(['title'], formName: 'fooForm');
});
```

## Actions

You can call an action by passing its form component name, and then the name of the action to `callFormComponentAction()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can send invoices', function () {
    $invoice = Invoice::factory()->create();

    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])
        ->callFormComponentAction('customer_id', 'send');

    expect($invoice->refresh())
        ->isSent()->toBeTrue();
});
```

To pass an array of data into an action, use the `data` parameter:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can send invoices', function () {
    $invoice = Invoice::factory()->create();

    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])
        ->callFormComponentAction('customer_id', 'send', data: [
            'email' => $email = fake()->email(),
        ])
        ->assertHasNoFormComponentActionErrors();

    expect($invoice->refresh())
        ->isSent()->toBeTrue()
        ->recipient_email->toBe($email);
});
```

If you ever need to only set an action's data without immediately calling it, you can use `setFormComponentActionData()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can send invoices', function () {
    $invoice = Invoice::factory()->create();

    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])
        ->mountFormComponentAction('customer_id', 'send')
        ->setFormComponentActionData([
            'email' => $email = fake()->email(),
        ])
});
```

### Execution

To check if an action has been halted, you can use `assertFormComponentActionHalted()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('stops sending if invoice has no email address', function () {
    $invoice = Invoice::factory(['email' => null])->create();

    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])
        ->callFormComponentAction('customer_id', 'send')
        ->assertFormComponentActionHalted('customer_id', 'send');
});
```

### Errors

`assertHasNoFormComponentActionErrors()` is used to assert that no validation errors occurred when submitting the action form.

To check if a validation error has occurred with the data, use `assertHasFormComponentActionErrors()`, similar to `assertHasErrors()` in Livewire:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can validate invoice recipient email', function () {
    $invoice = Invoice::factory()->create();

    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])
        ->callFormComponentAction('customer_id', 'send', data: [
            'email' => Str::random(),
        ])
        ->assertHasFormComponentActionErrors(['email' => ['email']]);
});
```

To check if an action is pre-filled with data, you can use the `assertFormComponentActionDataSet()` method:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can send invoices to the primary contact by default', function () {
    $invoice = Invoice::factory()->create();
    $recipientEmail = $invoice->company->primaryContact->email;

    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])
        ->mountFormComponentAction('customer_id', 'send')
        ->assertFormComponentActionDataSet([
            'email' => $recipientEmail,
        ])
        ->callMountedFormComponentAction()
        ->assertHasNoFormComponentActionErrors();
        
    expect($invoice->refresh())
        ->isSent()->toBeTrue()
        ->recipient_email->toBe($recipientEmail);
});
```

### Action state

To ensure that an action exists or doesn't in a form, you can use the `assertFormComponentActionExists()` or  `assertFormComponentActionDoesNotExist()` method:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can send but not unsend invoices', function () {
    $invoice = Invoice::factory()->create();

    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])
        ->assertFormComponentActionExists('customer_id', 'send')
        ->assertFormComponentActionDoesNotExist('customer_id', 'unsend');
});
```

To ensure an action is hidden or visible for a user, you can use the `assertFormComponentActionHidden()` or `assertFormComponentActionVisible()` methods:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can only print customers', function () {
    $invoice = Invoice::factory()->create();

    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])
        ->assertFormComponentActionHidden('customer_id', 'send')
        ->assertFormComponentActionVisible('customer_id', 'print');
});
```

To ensure an action is enabled or disabled for a user, you can use the `assertFormComponentActionEnabled()` or `assertFormComponentActionDisabled()` methods:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can only print a customer for a sent invoice', function () {
    $invoice = Invoice::factory()->create();

    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])
        ->assertFormComponentActionDisabled('customer_id', 'send')
        ->assertFormComponentActionEnabled('customer_id', 'print');
});
```

To check if an action is hidden to a user, you can use the `assertFormComponentActionHidden()` method:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can not send invoices', function () {
    $invoice = Invoice::factory()->create();

    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])
        ->assertFormComponentActionHidden('customer_id', 'send');
});
```

### Button appearance

To ensure an action has the correct label, you can use `assertFormComponentActionHasLabel()` and `assertFormComponentActionDoesNotHaveLabel()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('send action has correct label', function () {
    $invoice = Invoice::factory()->create();

    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])
        ->assertFormComponentActionHasLabel('customer_id', 'send', 'Email Invoice')
        ->assertFormComponentActionDoesNotHaveLabel('customer_id', 'send', 'Send');
});
```

To ensure an action's button is showing the correct icon, you can use `assertFormComponentActionHasIcon()` or `assertFormComponentActionDoesNotHaveIcon()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('when enabled the send button has correct icon', function () {
    $invoice = Invoice::factory()->create();

    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])
        ->assertFormComponentActionEnabled('customer_id', 'send')
        ->assertFormComponentActionHasIcon('customer_id', 'send', 'envelope-open')
        ->assertFormComponentActionDoesNotHaveIcon('customer_id', 'send', 'envelope');
});
```

To ensure that an action's button is displaying the right color, you can use `assertFormComponentActionHasColor()` or `assertFormComponentActionDoesNotHaveColor()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('actions display proper colors', function () {
    $invoice = Invoice::factory()->create();

    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])
        ->assertFormComponentActionHasColor('customer_id', 'delete', 'danger')
        ->assertFormComponentActionDoesNotHaveColor('customer_id', 'print', 'danger');
});
```

### URL

To ensure an action has the correct URL, you can use `assertFormComponentActionHasUrl()`, `assertFormComponentActionDoesNotHaveUrl()`, `assertFormComponentActionShouldOpenUrlInNewTab()`, and `assertFormComponentActionShouldNotOpenUrlInNewTab()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('links to the correct Filament sites', function () {
    $invoice = Invoice::factory()->create();

    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])
        ->assertFormComponentActionHasUrl('customer_id', 'filament', 'https://filamentphp.com/')
        ->assertFormComponentActionDoesNotHaveUrl('customer_id', 'filament', 'https://github.com/filamentphp/filament')
        ->assertFormComponentActionShouldOpenUrlInNewTab('customer_id', 'filament')
        ->assertFormComponentActionShouldNotOpenUrlInNewTab('customer_id', 'github');
});
```

# Documentation for forms. File: 10-upgrade-guide.md

title: Upgrading from v2.x
---

> If you see anything missing from this guide, please do not hesitate to [make a pull request](https://github.com/filamentphp/filament/edit/3.x/packages/forms/docs/10-upgrade-guide.md) to our repository! Any help is appreciated!

## New requirements

- Laravel v10.0+
- Livewire v3.0+

Please upgrade Filament before upgrading to Livewire v3. Instructions on how to upgrade Livewire can be found [here](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/upgrading).

## Upgrading automatically

The easiest way to upgrade your app is to run the automated upgrade script. This script will automatically upgrade your application to the latest version of Filament, and make changes to your code which handle most breaking changes.

```bash
composer require filament/upgrade:"^3.2" -W --dev
vendor/bin/filament-v3
```

Make sure to carefully follow the instructions, and review the changes made by the script. You may need to make some manual changes to your code afterwards, but the script should handle most of the repetitive work for you.

Finally, you must run `php artisan filament:install` to finalize the Filament v3 installation. This command must be run for all new Filament projects.

You can now `composer remove filament/upgrade` as you don't need it anymore.

> Some plugins you're using may not be available in v3 just yet. You could temporarily remove them from your `composer.json` file until they've been upgraded, replace them with a similar plugins that are v3-compatible, wait for the plugins to be upgraded before upgrading your app, or even write PRs to help the authors upgrade them.

## Upgrading manually

After upgrading the dependency via Composer, you should execute `php artisan filament:upgrade` in order to clear any Laravel caches and publish the new frontend assets.

### High-impact changes

#### Config file renamed and combined with other Filament packages

Only one config file is now used for all Filament packages. Most configuration has been moved into other parts of the codebase, and little remains. You should use the v3 documentation as a reference when replace the configuration options you did modify. To publish the new configuration file and remove the old one, run:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=filament-config --force
rm config/forms.php
```

#### `FORMS_FILESYSTEM_DRIVER` .env variable

The `FORMS_FILESYSTEM_DRIVER` .env variable has been renamed to `FILAMENT_FILESYSTEM_DISK`. This is to make it more consistent with Laravel, as Laravel v9 introduced this change as well. Please ensure that you update your .env files accordingly, and don't forget production!

#### New `@filamentScripts` and `@filamentStyles` Blade directives

The `@filamentScripts` and `@filamentStyles` Blade directives must be added to your Blade layout file/s. Since Livewire v3 no longer uses similar directives, you can replace `@livewireScripts` with `@filamentScripts`  and `@livewireStyles` with `@filamentStyles`.

#### CSS file removed

The CSS file for form components, `module.esm.css`, has been removed. Check `resources/css/app.css`. That CSS is now automatically loaded by `@filamentStyles`.

#### JavaScript files removed

You no longer need to import the `FormsAlpinePlugin` in your JavaScript files. Alpine plugins are now automatically loaded by `@filamentScripts`.

#### Heroicons have been updated to v2

The Heroicons library has been updated to v2. This means that any icons you use in your app may have changed names. You can find a list of changes [here](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/heroicons/releases/tag/v2.0.0).

### Medium-impact changes

#### Date-time pickers

The date-time picker form field now uses the browser's native date picker by default. It usually has a better UX than the old date picker, but you may notice features missing, bad browser compatibility, or behavioral bugs. If you want to revert to the old date picker, you can use the `native(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\DateTimePicker;

DateTimePicker::make('published_at')
    ->native(false)
```

#### Secondary color

Filament v2 had a `secondary` color for many components which was gray. All references to `secondary` should be replaced with `gray` to preserve the same appearance. This frees `secondary` to be registered to a new custom color of your choice.

#### `$get` and `$set` closure parameters

`$get` and `$set` parameters now use a type of either `\Filament\Forms\Get` or `\Filament\Forms\Set` instead of `\Closure`. This allows for better IDE autocomplete support of each function's parameters.

An easy way to upgrade your code quickly is to find and replace:

- `Closure $get` to `\Filament\Forms\Get $get`
- `Closure $set` to `\Filament\Forms\Set $set`

#### `TextInput` masks now use Alpine.js' masking package

Filament v2 had a fluent mask object syntax for managing input masks. In v3, you can use Alpine.js's masking syntax instead. Please see the [input masking documentation](fields/text-input#input-masking) for more information.

### Low-impact changes

#### Rule modification callback parameter renamed

The parameter for modifying rule objects has been renamed to `modifyRuleUsing()`, affecting:

- `exists()`
- `unique()`

# Documentation for infolists. File: 01-installation.md
---
title: Installation
---

**The Infolist Builder package is pre-installed with the [Panel Builder](/docs/panels).** This guide is for using the Infolist Builder package in a custom TALL Stack application (Tailwind, Alpine, Livewire, Laravel).

## Requirements

Filament requires the following to run:

- PHP 8.1+
- Laravel v10.0+
- Livewire v3.0+
- Tailwind v3.0+ [(Using Tailwind v4?)](#installing-tailwind-css)

## Installation

Require the Infolist Builder package using Composer:

```bash
composer require filament/infolists:"^3.3" -W
```

## New Laravel projects

To quickly get started with Filament in a new Laravel project, run the following commands to install [Livewire](https://livewire.laravel.com), [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com):

> Since these commands will overwrite existing files in your application, only run this in a new Laravel project!

```bash
php artisan filament:install --scaffold --infolists

npm install

npm run dev
```

## Existing Laravel projects

Run the following command to install the Infolist Builder package assets:

```bash
php artisan filament:install --infolists
```

### Installing Tailwind CSS

> Filament uses Tailwind CSS v3 for styling. If your project uses Tailwind CSS v4, you will unfortunately need to downgrade it to v3 to use Filament. Filament v3 can't support Tailwind CSS v4 since it introduces breaking changes. Filament v4 will support Tailwind CSS v4.

Run the following command to install Tailwind CSS with the Tailwind Forms and Typography plugins:

```bash
npm install tailwindcss@3 @tailwindcss/forms @tailwindcss/typography postcss postcss-nesting autoprefixer --save-dev
```

Create a new `tailwind.config.js` file and add the Filament `preset` *(includes the Filament color scheme and the required Tailwind plugins)*:

```js
import preset from './vendor/filament/support/tailwind.config.preset'

export default {
    presets: [preset],
    content: [
        './app/Filament/**/*.php',
        './resources/views/filament/**/*.blade.php',
        './vendor/filament/**/*.blade.php',
    ],
}
```

### Configuring styles

Add Tailwind's CSS layers to your `resources/css/app.css`:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
@tailwind variants;
```

Create a `postcss.config.js` file in the root of your project and register Tailwind CSS, PostCSS Nesting and Autoprefixer as plugins:

```js
export default {
    plugins: {
        'tailwindcss/nesting': 'postcss-nesting',
        tailwindcss: {},
        autoprefixer: {},
    },
}
```

### Automatically refreshing the browser
You may also want to update your `vite.config.js` file to refresh the page automatically when Livewire components are updated:

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import laravel, { refreshPaths } from 'laravel-vite-plugin'

export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [
        laravel({
            input: ['resources/css/app.css', 'resources/js/app.js'],
            refresh: [
                ...refreshPaths,
                'app/Livewire/**',
            ],
        }),
    ],
})
```

### Compiling assets

Compile your new CSS and Javascript assets using `npm run dev`.

### Configuring your layout

Create a new `resources/views/components/layouts/app.blade.php` layout file for Livewire components:

```blade
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="{{ str_replace('_', '-', app()->getLocale()) }}">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">

        <meta name="application-name" content="{{ config('app.name') }}">
        <meta name="csrf-token" content="{{ csrf_token() }}">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

        <title>{{ config('app.name') }}</title>

        <style>
            [x-cloak] {
                display: none !important;
            }
        </style>

        @filamentStyles
        @vite('resources/css/app.css')
    </head>

    <body class="antialiased">
        {{ $slot }}

        @filamentScripts
        @vite('resources/js/app.js')
    </body>
</html>
```

## Publishing configuration

You can publish the package configuration using the following command (optional):

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=filament-config
```

## Upgrading

Filament automatically upgrades to the latest non-breaking version when you run `composer update`. After any updates, all Laravel caches need to be cleared, and frontend assets need to be republished. You can do this all at once using the `filament:upgrade` command, which should have been added to your `composer.json` file when you ran `filament:install` the first time:

```json
"post-autoload-dump": [
    // ...
    "@php artisan filament:upgrade"
],
```

Please note that `filament:upgrade` does not actually handle the update process, as Composer does that already. If you're upgrading manually without a `post-autoload-dump` hook, you can run the command yourself:

```bash
composer update

php artisan filament:upgrade
```

# Documentation for infolists. File: 02-getting-started.md
---
title: Getting started
---

## Overview

Filament's infolist package allows you to [render a read-only list of data about a particular entity](adding-an-infolist-to-a-livewire-component). It's also used within other Filament packages, such as the [Panel Builder](../panels) for displaying [app resources](../panels/resources/getting-started) and [relation managers](../panels/resources/relation-managers), as well as for [action modals](../actions). Learning the features of the Infolist Builder will be incredibly time-saving when both building your own custom Livewire applications and using Filament's other packages.

This guide will walk you through the basics of building infolists with Filament's infolist package. If you're planning to add a new infolist to your own Livewire component, you should [do that first](adding-an-infolist-to-a-livewire-component) and then come back. If you're adding an infolist to an [app resource](../panels/resources/getting-started), or another Filament package, you're ready to go!

## Defining entries

The first step to building an infolist is to define the entries that will be displayed in the list. You can do this by calling the `schema()` method on an `Infolist` object. This method accepts an array of entry objects.

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

$infolist
    ->schema([
        TextEntry::make('title'),
        TextEntry::make('slug'),
        TextEntry::make('content'),
    ]);
```

Each entry is a piece of information that should be displayed in the infolist. The `TextEntry` is used for displaying text, but there are [other entry types available](entries/getting-started#available-entries).

Infolists within the Panel Builder and other packages usually have 2 columns by default. For custom infolists, you can use the `columns()` method to achieve the same effect:

```php
$infolist
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->columns(2);
```

Now, the `content` entry will only consume half of the available width. We can use the `columnSpan()` method to make it span the full width:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

[
    TextEntry::make('title'),
    TextEntry::make('slug')
    TextEntry::make('content')
        ->columnSpan(2), // or `columnSpan('full')`,
]
```

You can learn more about columns and spans in the [layout documentation](layout/grid). You can even make them responsive!

## Using layout components

The Infolist Builder allows you to use [layout components](layout/getting-started#available-layout-components) inside the schema array to control how entries are displayed. `Section` is a layout component, and it allows you to add a heading and description to a set of entries. It can also allow entries inside it to collapse, which saves space in long infolists.

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\Section;
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

[
    TextEntry::make('title'),
    TextEntry::make('slug'),
    TextEntry::make('content')
        ->columnSpan(2)
        ->markdown(),
    Section::make('Media')
        ->description('Images used in the page layout.')
        ->schema([
            // ...
        ]),
]
```

In this example, you can see how the `Section` component has its own `schema()` method. You can use this to nest other entries and layout components inside:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\ImageEntry;
use Filament\Infolists\Components\Section;
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

Section::make('Media')
    ->description('Images used in the page layout.')
    ->schema([
        ImageEntry::make('hero_image'),
        TextEntry::make('alt_text'),
    ])
```

This section now contains an [`ImageEntry`](entries/image) and a [`TextEntry`](entries/text). You can learn more about those entries and their functionalities on the respective docs pages.

# Documentation for infolists. File: 03-entries/01-getting-started.md

title: Getting started
---
import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"

## Overview

Entry classes can be found in the `Filament\Infolists\Components` namespace. You can put them inside the `$infolist->schema()` method:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Infolist;

public function infolist(Infolist $infolist): Infolist
{
    return $infolist
        ->schema([
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

If you're inside a [panel builder resource](../../panels/resources), the `infolist()` method should be static:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Infolist;

public static function infolist(Infolist $infolist): Infolist
{
    return $infolist
        ->schema([
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

Entries may be created using the static `make()` method, passing its unique name. You may use "dot notation" to access entries within relationships.

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('title')

TextEntry::make('author.name')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/simple" alt="Entries in an infolist" version="3.x" />

## Available entries

- [Text entry](text)
- [Icon entry](icon)
- [Image entry](image)
- [Color entry](color)
- [Key-value entry](key-value)
- [Repeatable entry](repeatable)

You may also [create your own custom entries](custom) to display data however you wish.

## Setting a label

By default, the label of the entry, which is displayed in the header of the infolist, is generated from the name of the entry. You may customize this using the `label()` method:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('title')
    ->label('Post title')
```

Optionally, you can have the label automatically translated [using Laravel's localization features](https://laravel.com/docs/localization) with the `translateLabel()` method:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('title')
    ->translateLabel() // Equivalent to `label(__('Title'))`
```

## Entry URLs

When an entry is clicked, you may open a URL.

### Opening URLs

To open a URL, you may use the `url()` method, passing a callback or static URL to open. Callbacks accept a `$record` parameter which you may use to customize the URL:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('title')
    ->url(fn (Post $record): string => route('posts.edit', ['post' => $record]))
```

You may also choose to open the URL in a new tab:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('title')
    ->url(fn (Post $record): string => route('posts.edit', ['post' => $record]))
    ->openUrlInNewTab()
```

## Setting a default value

To set a default value for entries with an empty state, you may use the `default()` method. This method will treat the default state as if it were real, so entries like [image](image) or [color](color) will display the default image or color.

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('title')
    ->default('Untitled')
```

## Adding placeholder text if an entry is empty

Sometimes you may want to display placeholder text for entries with an empty state, which is styled as a lighter gray text. This differs from the [default value](#setting-a-default-value), as the placeholder is always text and not treated as if it were real state.

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('title')
    ->placeholder('Untitled')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/placeholder" alt="Entry with a placeholder for empty state" version="3.x" />

## Adding helper text below the entry

Sometimes, you may wish to provide extra information for the user of the infolist. For this purpose, you may add helper text below the entry.

The `helperText()` method is used to add helper text:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('name')
    ->helperText('Your full name here, including any middle names.')
```

This method accepts a plain text string, or an instance of `Illuminate\Support\HtmlString` or `Illuminate\Contracts\Support\Htmlable`. This allows you to render HTML, or even markdown, in the helper text:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;
use Illuminate\Support\HtmlString;

TextEntry::make('name')
    ->helperText(new HtmlString('Your <strong>full name</strong> here, including any middle names.'))

TextEntry::make('name')
    ->helperText(str('Your **full name** here, including any middle names.')->inlineMarkdown()->toHtmlString())

TextEntry::make('name')
    ->helperText(view('name-helper-text'))
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/helper-text" alt="Entry with helper text" version="3.x" />

## Adding a hint next to the label

As well as [helper text](#adding-helper-text-below-the-entry) below the entry, you may also add a "hint" next to the label of the entry. This is useful for displaying additional information about the entry, such as a link to a help page.

The `hint()` method is used to add a hint:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('apiKey')
    ->label('API key')
    ->hint('Documentation? What documentation?!')
```

This method accepts a plain text string, or an instance of `Illuminate\Support\HtmlString` or `Illuminate\Contracts\Support\Htmlable`. This allows you to render HTML, or even markdown, in the helper text:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('apiKey')
    ->label('API key')
    ->hint(new HtmlString('<a href="/documentation">Documentation</a>'))

TextEntry::make('apiKey')
    ->label('API key')
    ->hint(str('[Documentation](/documentation)')->inlineMarkdown()->toHtmlString())

TextEntry::make('apiKey')
    ->label('API key')
    ->hint(view('api-key-hint'))
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/hint" alt="Entry with hint" version="3.x" />

### Changing the text color of the hint

You can change the text color of the hint. By default, it's gray, but you may use `danger`, `info`, `primary`, `success` and `warning`:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('apiKey')
    ->label('API key')
    ->hint(str('[Documentation](/documentation)')->inlineMarkdown()->toHtmlString())
    ->hintColor('primary')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/hint-color" alt="Entry with hint color" version="3.x" />

### Adding an icon aside the hint

Hints may also have an [icon](https://blade-ui-kit.com/blade-icons?set=1#search) rendered next to them:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('apiKey')
    ->label('API key')
    ->hint(str('[Documentation](/documentation)')->inlineMarkdown()->toHtmlString())
    ->hintIcon('heroicon-m-question-mark-circle')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/hint-icon" alt="Entry with hint icon" version="3.x" />

#### Adding a tooltip to a hint icon

Additionally, you can add a tooltip to display when you hover over the hint icon, using the `tooltip` parameter of `hintIcon()`:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('apiKey')
    ->label('API key')
    ->hint(str('[Documentation](/documentation)')->inlineMarkdown()->toHtmlString())
    ->hintIcon('heroicon-m-question-mark-circle', tooltip: 'Read it!')
```

## Hiding entries

To hide an entry conditionally, you may use the `hidden()` and `visible()` methods, whichever you prefer:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('role')
    ->hidden(! auth()->user()->isAdmin())
// or
TextEntry::make('role')
    ->visible(auth()->user()->isAdmin())
```

## Calculated state

Sometimes you need to calculate the state of an entry, instead of directly reading it from a database entry.

By passing a callback function to the `state()` method, you can customize the returned state for that entry:

```php
Infolists\Components\TextEntry::make('amount_including_vat')
    ->state(function (Model $record): float {
        return $record->amount * (1 + $record->vat_rate);
    })
```

## Tooltips

You may specify a tooltip to display when you hover over an entry:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('title')
    ->tooltip('Shown at the top of the page')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/tooltips" alt="Entry with tooltip" version="3.x" />

This method also accepts a closure that can access the current infolist record:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

TextEntry::make('title')
    ->tooltip(fn (Model $record): string => "By {$record->author->name}")
```

## Custom attributes

The HTML of entries can be customized, by passing an array of `extraAttributes()`:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('slug')
    ->extraAttributes(['class' => 'bg-gray-200'])
```

These get merged onto the outer `<div>` element of each entry in that entry.

You can also pass extra HTML attributes to the entry wrapper which surrounds the label, entry, and any other text:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('slug')
    ->extraEntryWrapperAttributes(['class' => 'entry-locked'])
```

## Global settings

If you wish to change the default behavior of all entries globally, then you can call the static `configureUsing()` method inside a service provider's `boot()` method, to which you pass a Closure to modify the entries using. For example, if you wish to make all `TextEntry` components [`words(10)`](text#limiting-word-count), you can do it like so:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::configureUsing(function (TextEntry $entry): void {
    $entry
        ->words(10);
});
```

Of course, you are still able to overwrite this on each entry individually:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('name')

title: Text entry
---
import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"

## Overview

Text entries display simple text:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('title')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/text/simple" alt="Text entry" version="3.x" />

## Displaying as a "badge"

By default, text is quite plain and has no background color. You can make it appear as a "badge" instead using the `badge()` method. A great use case for this is with statuses, where may want to display a badge with a [color](#customizing-the-color) that matches the status:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('status')
    ->badge()
    ->color(fn (string $state): string => match ($state) {
        'draft' => 'gray',
        'reviewing' => 'warning',
        'published' => 'success',
        'rejected' => 'danger',
    })
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/text/badge" alt="Text entry as badge" version="3.x" />

You may add other things to the badge, like an [icon](#adding-an-icon).

## Date formatting

You may use the `date()` and `dateTime()` methods to format the entry's state using [PHP date formatting tokens](https://www.php.net/manual/en/datetime.format.php):

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('created_at')
    ->dateTime()
```

You may use the `since()` method to format the entry's state using [Carbon's `diffForHumans()`](https://carbon.nesbot.com/docs/#api-humandiff):

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('created_at')
    ->since()
```

Additionally, you can use the `dateTooltip()`, `dateTimeTooltip()` or `timeTooltip()` method to display a formatted date in a tooltip, often to provide extra information:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('created_at')
    ->since()
    ->dateTimeTooltip()
```

## Number formatting

The `numeric()` method allows you to format an entry as a number:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('stock')
    ->numeric()
```

If you would like to customize the number of decimal places used to format the number with, you can use the `decimalPlaces` argument:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('stock')
    ->numeric(decimalPlaces: 0)
```

By default, your app's locale will be used to format the number suitably. If you would like to customize the locale used, you can pass it to the `locale` argument:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('stock')
    ->numeric(locale: 'nl')
```

Alternatively, you can set the default locale used across your app using the `Infolist::$defaultNumberLocale` method in the `boot()` method of a service provider:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Infolist;

Infolist::$defaultNumberLocale = 'nl';
```

## Currency formatting

The `money()` method allows you to easily format monetary values, in any currency:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('price')
    ->money('EUR')
```

There is also a `divideBy` argument for `money()` that allows you to divide the original value by a number before formatting it. This could be useful if your database stores the price in cents, for example:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('price')
    ->money('EUR', divideBy: 100)
```

By default, your app's locale will be used to format the money suitably. If you would like to customize the locale used, you can pass it to the `locale` argument:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('price')
    ->money('EUR', locale: 'nl')
```

Alternatively, you can set the default locale used across your app using the `Infolist::$defaultNumberLocale` method in the `boot()` method of a service provider:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Infolist;

Infolist::$defaultNumberLocale = 'nl';
```

## Limiting text length

You may `limit()` the length of the entry's value:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('description')
    ->limit(50)
```

You may also reuse the value that is being passed to `limit()`:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('description')
    ->limit(50)
    ->tooltip(function (TextEntry $component): ?string {
        $state = $component->getState();

        if (strlen($state) <= $component->getCharacterLimit()) {
            return null;
        }

        // Only render the tooltip if the entry contents exceeds the length limit.
        return $state;
    })
```

## Limiting word count

You may limit the number of `words()` displayed in the entry:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('description')
    ->words(10)
```

## Limiting text to a specific number of lines

You may want to limit text to a specific number of lines instead of limiting it to a fixed length. Clamping text to a number of lines is useful in responsive interfaces where you want to ensure a consistent experience across all screen sizes. This can be achieved using the `lineClamp()` method:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('description')
    ->lineClamp(2)
```

## Listing multiple values

By default, if there are multiple values inside your text entry, they will be comma-separated. You may use the `listWithLineBreaks()` method to display them on new lines instead:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('authors.name')
    ->listWithLineBreaks()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/text/list" alt="Text entry with multiple values" version="3.x" />

### Adding bullet points to the list

You may add a bullet point to each list item using the `bulleted()` method:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('authors.name')
    ->listWithLineBreaks()
    ->bulleted()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/text/bullet-list" alt="Text entry with multiple values and bullet points" version="3.x" />

### Limiting the number of values in the list

You can limit the number of values in the list using the `limitList()` method:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('authors.name')
    ->listWithLineBreaks()
    ->limitList(3)
```

#### Expanding the limited list

You can allow the limited items to be expanded and collapsed, using the `expandableLimitedList()` method:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('authors.name')
    ->listWithLineBreaks()
    ->limitList(3)
    ->expandableLimitedList()
```

Please note that this is only a feature for `listWithLineBreaks()` or `bulleted()`, where each item is on its own line.

### Using a list separator

If you want to "explode" a text string from your model into multiple list items, you can do so with the `separator()` method. This is useful for displaying comma-separated tags [as badges](#displaying-as-a-badge), for example:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('tags')
    ->badge()
    ->separator(',')
```

## Rendering HTML

If your entry value is HTML, you may render it using `html()`:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('description')
    ->html()
```

If you use this method, then the HTML will be sanitized to remove any potentially unsafe content before it is rendered. If you'd like to opt out of this behavior, you can wrap the HTML in an `HtmlString` object by formatting it:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;
use Illuminate\Support\HtmlString;

TextEntry::make('description')
    ->formatStateUsing(fn (string $state): HtmlString => new HtmlString($state))
```

Or, you can return a `view()` object from the `formatStateUsing()` method, which will also not be sanitized:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;
use Illuminate\Contracts\View\View;

TextEntry::make('description')
    ->formatStateUsing(fn (string $state): View => view(
        'filament.infolists.components.description-entry-content',
        ['state' => $state],
    ))
```

### Rendering Markdown as HTML

If your entry value is Markdown, you may render it using `markdown()`:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('description')
    ->markdown()
```

## Custom formatting

You may instead pass a custom formatting callback to `formatStateUsing()`, which accepts the `$state` of the entry, and optionally its `$record`:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('status')
    ->formatStateUsing(fn (string $state): string => __("statuses.{$state}"))
```

## Customizing the color

You may set a color for the text, either `danger`, `gray`, `info`, `primary`, `success` or `warning`:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('status')
    ->color('primary')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/text/color" alt="Text entry in the primary color" version="3.x" />

## Adding an icon

Text entries may also have an [icon](https://blade-ui-kit.com/blade-icons?set=1#search):

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('email')
    ->icon('heroicon-m-envelope')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/text/icon" alt="Text entry with icon" version="3.x" />

You may set the position of an icon using `iconPosition()`:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;
use Filament\Support\Enums\IconPosition;

TextEntry::make('email')
    ->icon('heroicon-m-envelope')
    ->iconPosition(IconPosition::After) // `IconPosition::Before` or `IconPosition::After`
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/text/icon-after" alt="Text entry with icon after" version="3.x" />

The icon color defaults to the text color, but you may customize the icon color separately using `iconColor()`:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('email')
    ->icon('heroicon-m-envelope')
    ->iconColor('primary')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/text/icon-color" alt="Text entry with icon in the primary color" version="3.x" />

## Customizing the text size

Text columns have small font size by default, but you may change this to `TextEntrySize::ExtraSmall`, `TextEntrySize::Medium`, or `TextEntrySize::Large`.

For instance, you may make the text larger using `size(TextEntrySize::Large)`:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('title')
    ->size(TextEntry\TextEntrySize::Large)
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/text/large" alt="Text entry in a large font size" version="3.x" />

## Customizing the font weight

Text entries have regular font weight by default, but you may change this to any of the following options: `FontWeight::Thin`, `FontWeight::ExtraLight`, `FontWeight::Light`, `FontWeight::Medium`, `FontWeight::SemiBold`, `FontWeight::Bold`, `FontWeight::ExtraBold` or `FontWeight::Black`.

For instance, you may make the font bold using `weight(FontWeight::Bold)`:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;
use Filament\Support\Enums\FontWeight;

TextEntry::make('title')
    ->weight(FontWeight::Bold)
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/text/bold" alt="Text entry in a bold font" version="3.x" />

## Customizing the font family

You can change the text font family to any of the following options: `FontFamily::Sans`, `FontFamily::Serif` or `FontFamily::Mono`.

For instance, you may make the font monospaced using `fontFamily(FontFamily::Mono)`:

```php
use Filament\Support\Enums\FontFamily;
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('apiKey')
    ->label('API key')
    ->fontFamily(FontFamily::Mono)
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/text/mono" alt="Text entry in a monospaced font" version="3.x" />

## Allowing the text to be copied to the clipboard

You may make the text copyable, such that clicking on the entry copies the text to the clipboard, and optionally specify a custom confirmation message and duration in milliseconds. This feature only works when SSL is enabled for the app.

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('apiKey')
    ->label('API key')
    ->copyable()
    ->copyMessage('Copied!')
    ->copyMessageDuration(1500)
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/text/copyable" alt="Text entry with a button to copy it" version="3.x" />

# Documentation for infolists. File: 03-entries/03-icon.md
---
title: Icon entry
---
import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"

## Overview

Icon entries render an [icon](https://blade-ui-kit.com/blade-icons?set=1#search) representing their contents:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\IconEntry;

IconEntry::make('status')
    ->icon(fn (string $state): string => match ($state) {
        'draft' => 'heroicon-o-pencil',
        'reviewing' => 'heroicon-o-clock',
        'published' => 'heroicon-o-check-circle',
    })
```

In the function, `$state` is the value of the entry, and `$record` can be used to access the underlying Eloquent record.

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/icon/simple" alt="Icon entry" version="3.x" />

## Customizing the color

Icon entries may also have a set of icon colors, using the same syntax. They may be either `danger`, `gray`, `info`, `primary`, `success` or `warning`:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\IconEntry;

IconEntry::make('status')
    ->color(fn (string $state): string => match ($state) {
        'draft' => 'info',
        'reviewing' => 'warning',
        'published' => 'success',
        default => 'gray',
    })
```

In the function, `$state` is the value of the entry, and `$record` can be used to access the underlying Eloquent record.

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/icon/color" alt="Icon entry with color" version="3.x" />

## Customizing the size

The default icon size is `IconEntrySize::Large`, but you may customize the size to be either `IconEntrySize::ExtraSmall`, `IconEntrySize::Small`, `IconEntrySize::Medium`, `IconEntrySize::ExtraLarge` or `IconEntrySize::TwoExtraLarge`:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\IconEntry;

IconEntry::make('status')
    ->size(IconEntry\IconEntrySize::Medium)
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/icon/medium" alt="Medium-sized icon entry" version="3.x" />

## Handling booleans

Icon entries can display a check or cross icon based on the contents of the database entry, either true or false, using the `boolean()` method:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\IconEntry;

IconEntry::make('is_featured')
    ->boolean()
```

> If this column in the model class is already cast as a `bool` or `boolean`, Filament is able to detect this, and you do not need to use `boolean()` manually.

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/icon/boolean" alt="Icon entry to display a boolean" version="3.x" />

### Customizing the boolean icons

You may customize the icon representing each state. Icons are the name of a Blade component present. By default, [Heroicons](https://heroicons.com) are installed:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\IconEntry;

IconEntry::make('is_featured')
    ->boolean()
    ->trueIcon('heroicon-o-check-badge')
    ->falseIcon('heroicon-o-x-mark')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/icon/boolean-icon" alt="Icon entry to display a boolean with custom icons" version="3.x" />

### Customizing the boolean colors

You may customize the icon color representing each state. These may be either `danger`, `gray`, `info`, `primary`, `success` or `warning`:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\IconEntry;

IconEntry::make('is_featured')
    ->boolean()
    ->trueColor('info')
    ->falseColor('warning')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/icon/boolean-color" alt="Icon entry to display a boolean with custom colors" version="3.x" />

# Documentation for infolists. File: 03-entries/04-image.md
---
title: Image entry
---
import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"

## Overview

Images can be easily displayed within your infolist:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\ImageEntry;

ImageEntry::make('header_image')
```

The entry must contain the path to the image, relative to the root directory of its storage disk, or an absolute URL to it.

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/image/simple" alt="Image entry" version="3.x" />

## Managing the image disk

By default, the `public` disk will be used to retrieve images. You may pass a custom disk name to the `disk()` method:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\ImageEntry;

ImageEntry::make('header_image')
    ->disk('s3')
```

## Private images

Filament can generate temporary URLs to render private images, you may set the `visibility()` to `private`:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\ImageEntry;

ImageEntry::make('header_image')
    ->visibility('private')
```

## Customizing the size

You may customize the image size by passing a `width()` and `height()`, or both with `size()`:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\ImageEntry;

ImageEntry::make('header_image')
    ->width(200)

ImageEntry::make('header_image')
    ->height(50)

ImageEntry::make('author.avatar')
    ->size(40)
```

## Square image

You may display the image using a 1:1 aspect ratio:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\ImageEntry;

ImageEntry::make('author.avatar')
    ->height(40)
    ->square()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/image/square" alt="Square image entry" version="3.x" />

## Circular image

You may make the image fully rounded, which is useful for rendering avatars:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\ImageEntry;

ImageEntry::make('author.avatar')
    ->height(40)
    ->circular()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/image/circular" alt="Circular image entry" version="3.x" />

## Adding a default image URL

You can display a placeholder image if one doesn't exist yet, by passing a URL to the `defaultImageUrl()` method:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\ImageEntry;

ImageEntry::make('avatar')
    ->defaultImageUrl(url('/images/placeholder.png'))
```

## Stacking images

You may display multiple images as a stack of overlapping images by using `stacked()`:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\ImageEntry;

ImageEntry::make('colleagues.avatar')
    ->height(40)
    ->circular()
    ->stacked()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/image/stacked" alt="Stacked image entry" version="3.x" />

### Customizing the stacked ring width

The default ring width is `3`, but you may customize it to be from `0` to `8`:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\ImageEntry;

ImageEntry::make('colleagues.avatar')
    ->height(40)
    ->circular()
    ->stacked()
    ->ring(5)
```

### Customizing the stacked overlap

The default overlap is `4`, but you may customize it to be from `0` to `8`:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\ImageEntry;

ImageEntry::make('colleagues.avatar')
    ->height(40)
    ->circular()
    ->stacked()
    ->overlap(2)
```

## Setting a limit

You may limit the maximum number of images you want to display by passing `limit()`:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\ImageEntry;

ImageEntry::make('colleagues.avatar')
    ->height(40)
    ->circular()
    ->stacked()
    ->limit(3)
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/image/limited" alt="Limited image entry" version="3.x" />

### Showing the remaining images count

When you set a limit you may also display the count of remaining images by passing `limitedRemainingText()`.

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\ImageEntry;

ImageEntry::make('colleagues.avatar')
    ->height(40)
    ->circular()
    ->stacked()
    ->limit(3)
    ->limitedRemainingText()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/image/limited-remaining-text" alt="Limited image entry with remaining text" version="3.x" />

#### Showing the limited remaining text separately

By default, `limitedRemainingText()` will display the count of remaining images as a number stacked on the other images. If you prefer to show the count as a number after the images, you may use the `isSeparate: true` parameter:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\ImageEntry;

ImageEntry::make('colleagues.avatar')
    ->height(40)
    ->circular()
    ->stacked()
    ->limit(3)
    ->limitedRemainingText(isSeparate: true)
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/image/limited-remaining-text-separately" alt="Limited image entry with remaining text separately" version="3.x" />

#### Customizing the limited remaining text size

By default, the size of the remaining text is `sm`. You can customize this to be `xs`, `md` or `lg` using the `size` parameter:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\ImageEntry;

ImageEntry::make('colleagues.avatar')
    ->height(40)
    ->circular()
    ->stacked()
    ->limit(3)
    ->limitedRemainingText(size: 'lg')
```

## Custom attributes

You may customize the extra HTML attributes of the image using `extraImgAttributes()`:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\ImageEntry;

ImageEntry::make('logo')
    ->extraImgAttributes([
        'alt' => 'Logo',
        'loading' => 'lazy',
    ]),
```

## Prevent file existence checks

When the infolist is loaded, it will automatically detect whether the images exist. This is all done on the backend. When using remote storage with many images, this can be time-consuming. You can use the `checkFileExistence(false)` method to disable this feature:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\ImageEntry;

ImageEntry::make('attachment')
    ->checkFileExistence(false)
```

# Documentation for infolists. File: 03-entries/05-color.md
---
title: Color entry
---
import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"

## Overview

The color entry allows you to show the color preview from a CSS color definition, typically entered using the color picker field, in one of the supported formats (HEX, HSL, RGB, RGBA).

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\ColorEntry;

ColorEntry::make('color')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/color/simple" alt="Color entry" version="3.x" />

## Allowing the color to be copied to the clipboard

You may make the color copyable, such that clicking on the preview copies the CSS value to the clipboard, and optionally specify a custom confirmation message and duration in milliseconds. This feature only works when SSL is enabled for the app.

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\ColorEntry;

ColorEntry::make('color')
    ->copyable()
    ->copyMessage('Copied!')
    ->copyMessageDuration(1500)
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/color/copyable" alt="Color entry with a button to copy it" version="3.x" />

# Documentation for infolists. File: 03-entries/06-key-value.md
---
title: Key-value entry
---
import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"

## Overview

The key-value entry allows you to render key-value pairs of data, from a one-dimensional JSON object / PHP array.

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\KeyValueEntry;

KeyValueEntry::make('meta')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/key-value/simple" alt="Key-value entry" version="3.x" />

If you're saving the data in Eloquent, you should be sure to add an `array` [cast](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-mutators#array-and-json-casting) to the model property:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Post extends Model
{
    protected $casts = [
        'meta' => 'array',
    ];

    // ...
}
```

## Customizing the key column's label

You may customize the label for the key column using the `keyLabel()` method:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\KeyValueEntry;

KeyValueEntry::make('meta')
    ->keyLabel('Property name')
```

## Customizing the value column's label

You may customize the label for the value column using the `valueLabel()` method:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\KeyValueEntry;

KeyValueEntry::make('meta')
    ->valueLabel('Property value')
```

# Documentation for infolists. File: 03-entries/07-repeatable.md
---
title: Repeatable entry
---
import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"

## Overview

The repeatable entry allows you to repeat a set of entries and layout components for items in an array or relationship.

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\RepeatableEntry;
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

RepeatableEntry::make('comments')
    ->schema([
        TextEntry::make('author.name'),
        TextEntry::make('title'),
        TextEntry::make('content')
            ->columnSpan(2),
    ])
    ->columns(2)
```

As you can see, the repeatable entry has an embedded `schema()` which gets repeated for each item.

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/repeatable/simple" alt="Repeatable entry" version="3.x" />

## Grid layout

You may organize repeatable items into columns by using the `grid()` method:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\RepeatableEntry;

RepeatableEntry::make('comments')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->grid(2)
```

This method accepts the same options as the `columns()` method of the [grid](../layout/grid). This allows you to responsively customize the number of grid columns at various breakpoints.

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/repeatable/grid" alt="Repeatable entry in grid layout" version="3.x" />

## Removing the styled container

By default, each item in a repeatable entry is wrapped in a container styled as a card. You may remove the styled container using `contained()`:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\RepeatableEntry;

RepeatableEntry::make('comments')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->contained(false)
```

## View entries

You may render a custom view for an entry using the `view()` method:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\ViewEntry;

ViewEntry::make('status')
    ->view('filament.infolists.entries.status-switcher')
```

This assumes that you have a `resources/views/filament/infolists/entries/status-switcher.blade.php` file.

## Custom classes

You may create your own custom entry classes and entry views, which you can reuse across your project, and even release as a plugin to the community.

> If you're just creating a simple custom entry to use once, you could instead use a [view entry](#view-entries) to render any custom Blade file.

To create a custom entry class and view, you may use the following command:

```bash
php artisan make:infolist-entry StatusSwitcher
```

This will create the following entry class:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\Entry;

class StatusSwitcher extends Entry
{
    protected string $view = 'filament.infolists.entries.status-switcher';
}
```

It will also create a view file at `resources/views/filament/infolists/entries/status-switcher.blade.php`.

## Accessing the state

Inside your view, you may retrieve the state of the entry using the `$getState()` function:

```blade
<div>
    {{ $getState() }}
</div>
```

## Accessing the Eloquent record

Inside your view, you may access the Eloquent record using the `$getRecord()` function:

```blade
<div>
    {{ $getRecord()->name }}
</div>
```

title: Getting started

## Overview

Infolists are not limited to just displaying entries. You can also use "layout components" to organize them into an infinitely nestable structure.

Layout component classes can be found in the `Filament\Infolists\Components` namespace. They reside within the schema of your infolist, alongside any [entries](../entries/getting-started).

Components may be created using the static `make()` method. Usually, you will then define the child component `schema()` to display inside:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\Grid;

Grid::make(2)
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
```

## Available layout components

Filament ships with some layout components, suitable for arranging your form fields depending on your needs:

- [Grid](grid)
- [Fieldset](fieldset)
- [Tabs](tabs)
- [Section](section)
- [Split](split)

You may also [create your own custom layout components](custom) to organize fields in whatever way you wish.

## Setting an ID

You may define an ID for the component using the `id()` method:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\Section;

Section::make()
    ->id('main-section')
```

## Adding extra HTML attributes

You can pass extra HTML attributes to the component, which will be merged onto the outer DOM element. Pass an array of attributes to the `extraAttributes()` method, where the key is the attribute name and the value is the attribute value:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\Group;

Section::make()
    ->extraAttributes(['class' => 'custom-section-style'])
```

Classes will be merged with the default classes, and any other attributes will override the default attributes.

## Global settings

If you wish to change the default behavior of a component globally, then you can call the static `configureUsing()` method inside a service provider's `boot()` method, to which you pass a Closure to modify the component using. For example, if you wish to make all section components have [2 columns](grid) by default, you can do it like so:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\Section;

Section::configureUsing(function (Section $section): void {
    $section
        ->columns(2);
});
```

Of course, you are still able to overwrite this on each field individually:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\Section;

Section::make()
    ->columns(1)
```

# Documentation for infolists. File: 04-layout/02-grid.md
---
title: Grid
---

## Overview

Filament's grid system allows you to create responsive, multi-column layouts using any layout component.

## Responsively setting the number of grid columns

All layout components have a `columns()` method that you can use in a couple of different ways:

- You can pass an integer like `columns(2)`. This integer is the number of columns used on the `lg` breakpoint and higher. All smaller devices will have just 1 column.
- You can pass an array, where the key is the breakpoint and the value is the number of columns. For example, `columns(['md' => 2, 'xl' => 4])` will create a 2 column layout on medium devices, and a 4 column layout on extra large devices. The default breakpoint for smaller devices uses 1 column, unless you use a `default` array key.

Breakpoints (`sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, `2xl`) are defined by Tailwind, and can be found in the [Tailwind documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design#overview).

## Controlling how many columns a component should span

In addition to specifying how many columns a layout component should have, you may also specify how many columns a component should fill within the parent grid, using the `columnSpan()` method. This method accepts an integer or an array of breakpoints and column spans:

- `columnSpan(2)` will make the component fill up to 2 columns on all breakpoints.
- `columnSpan(['md' => 2, 'xl' => 4])` will make the component fill up to 2 columns on medium devices, and up to 4 columns on extra large devices. The default breakpoint for smaller devices uses 1 column, unless you use a `default` array key.
- `columnSpan('full')` or `columnSpanFull()` or `columnSpan(['default' => 'full'])` will make the component fill the full width of the parent grid, regardless of how many columns it has.

## An example of a responsive grid layout

In this example, we have an infolist with a [section](section) layout component. Since all layout components support the `columns()` method, we can use it to create a responsive grid layout within the section itself.

We pass an array to `columns()` as we want to specify different numbers of columns for different breakpoints. On devices smaller than the `sm` [Tailwind breakpoint](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design#overview), we want to have 1 column, which is default. On devices larger than the `sm` breakpoint, we want to have 3 columns. On devices larger than the `xl` breakpoint, we want to have 6 columns. On devices larger than the `2xl` breakpoint, we want to have 8 columns.

Inside the section, we have a [text entry](../entries/text). Since text entries are infolist components and all form components have a `columnSpan()` method, we can use it to specify how many columns the text entry should fill. On devices smaller than the `sm` breakpoint, we want the text entry to fill 1 column, which is default. On devices larger than the `sm` breakpoint, we want the text entry to fill 2 columns. On devices larger than the `xl` breakpoint, we want the text entry to fill 3 columns. On devices larger than the `2xl` breakpoint, we want the text entry to fill 4 columns.

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\Section;
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

Section::make()
    ->columns([
        'sm' => 3,
        'xl' => 6,
        '2xl' => 8,
    ])
    ->schema([
        TextEntry::make('name')
            ->columnSpan([
                'sm' => 2,
                'xl' => 3,
                '2xl' => 4,
            ]),
        // ...
    ])
```

## Grid component

All layout components support the `columns()` method, but you also have access to an additional `Grid` component. If you feel that your form schema would benefit from an explicit grid syntax with no extra styling, it may be useful to you. Instead of using the `columns()` method, you can pass your column configuration directly to `Grid::make()`:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\Grid;

Grid::make([
    'default' => 1,
    'sm' => 2,
    'md' => 3,
    'lg' => 4,
    'xl' => 6,
    '2xl' => 8,
])
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
```

## Setting the starting column of a component in a grid

If you want to start a component in a grid at a specific column, you can use the `columnStart()` method. This method accepts an integer, or an array of breakpoints and which column the component should start at:

- `columnStart(2)` will make the component start at column 2 on all breakpoints.
- `columnStart(['md' => 2, 'xl' => 4])` will make the component start at column 2 on medium devices, and at column 4 on extra large devices. The default breakpoint for smaller devices uses 1 column, unless you use a `default` array key.

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\Grid;
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

Grid::make()
    ->columns([
        'sm' => 3,
        'xl' => 6,
        '2xl' => 8,
    ])
    ->schema([
        TextEntry::make('name')
            ->columnStart([
                'sm' => 2,
                'xl' => 3,
                '2xl' => 4,
            ]),
        // ...
    ])
```

In this example, the grid has 3 columns on small devices, 6 columns on extra large devices, and 8 columns on extra extra large devices. The text entry will start at column 2 on small devices, column 3 on extra large devices, and column 4 on extra extra large devices. This is essentially producing a layout whereby the text entry always starts halfway through the grid, regardless of how many columns the grid has.

# Documentation for infolists. File: 04-layout/03-fieldset.md
---
title: Fieldset
---
import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"

## Overview

You may want to group entries into a Fieldset. Each fieldset has a label, a border, and a two-column grid by default:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\Fieldset;

Fieldset::make('Label')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/layout/fieldset/simple" alt="Fieldset" version="3.x" />

## Using grid columns within a fieldset

You may use the `columns()` method to customize the [grid](grid) within the fieldset:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\Fieldset;

Fieldset::make('Label')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->columns(3)
```

# Documentation for infolists. File: 04-layout/04-tabs.md
---
title: Tabs
---
import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"

## Overview

Some infolists can be long and complex. You may want to use tabs to reduce the number of components that are visible at once:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\Tabs;

Tabs::make('Tabs')
    ->tabs([
        Tabs\Tab::make('Tab 1')
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]),
        Tabs\Tab::make('Tab 2')
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]),
        Tabs\Tab::make('Tab 3')
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]),
    ])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/layout/tabs/simple" alt="Tabs" version="3.x" />

## Setting the default active tab

The first tab will be open by default. You can change the default open tab using the `activeTab()` method:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\Tabs;

Tabs::make('Tabs')
    ->tabs([
        Tabs\Tab::make('Tab 1')
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]),
        Tabs\Tab::make('Tab 2')
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]),
        Tabs\Tab::make('Tab 3')
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]),
    ])
    ->activeTab(2)
```

## Setting a tab icon

Tabs may have an [icon](https://blade-ui-kit.com/blade-icons?set=1#search), which you can set using the `icon()` method:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\Tabs;

Tabs::make('Tabs')
    ->tabs([
        Tabs\Tab::make('Notifications')
            ->icon('heroicon-m-bell')
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]),
        // ...
    ])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/layout/tabs/icons" alt="Tabs with icons" version="3.x" />

### Setting the tab icon position

The icon of the tab may be positioned before or after the label using the `iconPosition()` method:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\Tabs;
use Filament\Support\Enums\IconPosition;

Tabs::make('Tabs')
    ->tabs([
        Tabs\Tab::make('Notifications')
            ->icon('heroicon-m-bell')
            ->iconPosition(IconPosition::After)
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]),
        // ...
    ])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/layout/tabs/icons-after" alt="Tabs with icons after their labels" version="3.x" />

## Setting a tab badge

Tabs may have a badge, which you can set using the `badge()` method:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\Tabs;

Tabs::make('Tabs')
    ->tabs([
        Tabs\Tab::make('Notifications')
            ->badge(5)
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]),
        // ...
    ])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/layout/tabs/badges" alt="Tabs with badges" version="3.x" />

If you'd like to change the color for a badge, you can use the `badgeColor()` method:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\Tabs;

Tabs::make('Tabs')
    ->tabs([
        Tabs\Tab::make('Notifications')
            ->badge(5)
            ->badgeColor('success')
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]),
        // ...
    ])
```

## Using grid columns within a tab

You may use the `columns()` method to customize the [grid](grid) within the tab:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\Tabs;

Tabs::make('Tabs')
    ->tabs([
        Tabs\Tab::make('Tab 1')
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ])
            ->columns(3),
        // ...
    ])
```

## Removing the styled container

By default, tabs and their content are wrapped in a container styled as a card. You may remove the styled container using `contained()`:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\Tabs;

Tabs::make('Tabs')
    ->tabs([
        Tabs\Tab::make('Tab 1')
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]),
        Tabs\Tab::make('Tab 2')
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]),
        Tabs\Tab::make('Tab 3')
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]),
    ])
    ->contained(false)
```

## Persisting the current tab

By default, the current tab is not persisted in the browser's local storage. You can change this behavior using the `persistTab()` method. You must also pass in a unique `id()` for the tabs component, to distinguish it from all other sets of tabs in the app. This ID will be used as the key in the local storage to store the current tab:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\Tabs;

Tabs::make('Tabs')
    ->tabs([
        // ...
    ])
    ->persistTab()
    ->id('order-tabs')
```

### Persisting the current tab in the URL's query string

By default, the current tab is not persisted in the URL's query string. You can change this behavior using the `persistTabInQueryString()` method:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\Tabs;

Tabs::make('Tabs')
    ->tabs([
        Tabs\Tab::make('Tab 1')
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]),
        Tabs\Tab::make('Tab 2')
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]),
        Tabs\Tab::make('Tab 3')
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]),
    ])
    ->persistTabInQueryString()
```

By default, the current tab is persisted in the URL's query string using the `tab` key. You can change this key by passing it to the `persistTabInQueryString()` method:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\Tabs;

Tabs::make('Tabs')
    ->tabs([
        Tabs\Tab::make('Tab 1')
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]),
        Tabs\Tab::make('Tab 2')
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]),
        Tabs\Tab::make('Tab 3')
            ->schema([
                // ...
            ]),
    ])
    ->persistTabInQueryString('settings-tab')
```

# Documentation for infolists. File: 04-layout/05-section.md
---
title: Section
---
import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"

## Overview

You may want to separate your entries into sections, each with a heading and description. To do this, you can use a section component:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\Section;

Section::make('Rate limiting')
    ->description('Prevent abuse by limiting the number of requests per period')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/layout/section/simple" alt="Section" version="3.x" />

You can also use a section without a header, which just wraps the components in a simple card:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\Section;

Section::make()
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/layout/section/without-header" alt="Section without header" version="3.x" />

## Adding actions to the section's header or footer

Sections can have actions in their [header](#adding-actions-to-the-sections-header) or [footer](#adding-actions-to-the-sections-footer).

### Adding actions to the section's header

You may add [actions](../actions) to the section's header using the `headerActions()` method:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Infolists\Components\Section;

Section::make('Rate limiting')
    ->headerActions([
        Action::make('edit')
            ->action(function () {
                // ...
            }),
    ])
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/layout/section/header/actions" alt="Section with header actions" version="3.x" />

> [Make sure the section has a heading or ID](#adding-actions-to-a-section-without-heading)

### Adding actions to the section's footer

In addition to [header actions](#adding-an-icon-to-the-sections-header), you may add [actions](../actions) to the section's footer using the `footerActions()` method:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Infolists\Components\Section;

Section::make('Rate limiting')
    ->footerActions([
        Action::make('edit')
            ->action(function () {
                // ...
            }),
    ])
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/layout/section/footer/actions" alt="Section with footer actions" version="3.x" />

> [Make sure the section has a heading or ID](#adding-actions-to-a-section-without-heading)

#### Aligning section footer actions

Footer actions are aligned to the inline start by default. You may customize the alignment using the `footerActionsAlignment()` method:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Infolists\Components\Section;
use Filament\Support\Enums\Alignment;

Section::make('Rate limiting')
    ->footerActions([
        Action::make('edit')
            ->action(function () {
                // ...
            }),
    ])
    ->footerActionsAlignment(Alignment::End)
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
```

### Adding actions to a section without heading

If your section does not have a heading, Filament has no way of locating the action inside it. In this case, you must pass a unique `id()` to the section:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\Section;

Section::make()
    ->id('rateLimitingSection')
    ->headerActions([
        // ...
    ])
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
```

## Adding an icon to the section's header

You may add an icon to the section's header using the `icon()` method:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\Section;

Section::make('Cart')
    ->description('The items you have selected for purchase')
    ->icon('heroicon-m-shopping-bag')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/layout/section/icons" alt="Section with icon" version="3.x" />

## Positioning the heading and description aside

You may use the `aside()` method to align the heading and description on the left, and the infolist components inside a card on the right:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\Section;

Section::make('Rate limiting')
    ->description('Prevent abuse by limiting the number of requests per period')
    ->aside()
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/layout/section/aside" alt="Section with heading and description aside" version="3.x" />

## Collapsing sections

Sections may be `collapsible()` to optionally hide content in long infolists:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\Section;

Section::make('Cart')
    ->description('The items you have selected for purchase')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->collapsible()
```

Your sections may be `collapsed()` by default:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\Section;

Section::make('Cart')
    ->description('The items you have selected for purchase')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->collapsed()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/layout/section/collapsed" alt="Collapsed section" version="3.x" />

### Persisting collapsed sections

You can persist whether a section is collapsed in local storage using the `persistCollapsed()` method, so it will remain collapsed when the user refreshes the page:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\Section;

Section::make('Cart')
    ->description('The items you have selected for purchase')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->collapsible()
    ->persistCollapsed()
```

To persist the collapse state, the local storage needs a unique ID to store the state. This ID is generated based on the heading of the section. If your section does not have a heading, or if you have multiple sections with the same heading that you do not want to collapse together, you can manually specify the `id()` of that section to prevent an ID conflict:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\Section;

Section::make('Cart')
    ->description('The items you have selected for purchase')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->collapsible()
    ->persistCollapsed()
    ->id('order-cart')
```

## Compact section styling

When nesting sections, you can use a more compact styling:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\Section;

Section::make('Rate limiting')
    ->description('Prevent abuse by limiting the number of requests per period')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->compact()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/layout/section/compact" alt="Compact section" version="3.x" />

## Using grid columns within a section

You may use the `columns()` method to easily create a [grid](grid) within the section:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\Section;

Section::make('Heading')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->columns(2)
```

    Section::make([
        TextEntry::make('title')
            ->weight(FontWeight::Bold),
        TextEntry::make('content')
            ->markdown()
            ->prose(),
    ]),
    Section::make([
        TextEntry::make('created_at')
            ->dateTime(),
        TextEntry::make('published_at')
            ->dateTime(),
    ])->grow(false),
])->from('md')
```

In this example, the first section will `grow()` to consume available horizontal space, without affecting the amount of space needed to render the second section. This creates a sidebar effect.

The `from()` method is used to control the [Tailwind breakpoint](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design#overview) (`sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, `2xl`) at which the split layout should be used. In this example, the split layout will be used on medium devices and larger. On smaller devices, the sections will stack on top of each other.

## View components

Aside from [building custom layout components](#custom-layout-classes), you may create "view" components which allow you to create custom layouts without extra PHP classes.

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\View;

View::make('filament.infolists.components.box')
```

This assumes that you have a `resources/views/filament/infolists/components/box.blade.php` file.

## Custom layout classes

You may create your own custom component classes and views, which you can reuse across your project, and even release as a plugin to the community.

> If you're just creating a simple custom component to use once, you could instead use a [view component](#view) to render any custom Blade file.

To create a custom component class and view, you may use the following command:

```bash
php artisan make:infolist-layout Box
```

This will create the following layout component class:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\Component;

class Box extends Component
{
    protected string $view = 'filament.infolists.components.box';

    public static function make(): static
    {
        return app(static::class);
    }
}
```

It will also create a view file at `resources/views/filament/infolists/components/box.blade.php`.

## Rendering the component's schema

Inside your view, you may render the component's `schema()` using the `$getChildComponentContainer()` function:

```blade
<div>
    {{ $getChildComponentContainer() }}
</div>
```

## Accessing the Eloquent record

Inside your view, you may access the Eloquent record using the `$getRecord()` function:

```blade
<div>
    {{ $getRecord()->name }}
</div>
```

# Documentation for infolists. File: 05-actions.md

import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"

## Overview

Filament's infolists can use [Actions](../actions). They are buttons that can be added to any infolist component. Also, you can [render anonymous sets of actions](#adding-anonymous-actions-to-an-infolist-without-attaching-them-to-a-component) on their own, that are not attached to a particular infolist component.

## Defining a infolist component action

Action objects inside an infolist component are instances of `Filament/Infolists/Components/Actions/Action`. You must pass a unique name to the action's `make()` method, which is used to identify it amongst others internally within Filament. You can [customize the trigger button](../actions/trigger-button) of an action, and even [open a modal](../actions/modals) with little effort:

```php
use App\Actions\ResetStars;
use Filament\Infolists\Components\Actions\Action;

Action::make('resetStars')
    ->icon('heroicon-m-x-mark')
    ->color('danger')
    ->requiresConfirmation()
    ->action(function (ResetStars $resetStars) {
        $resetStars();
    })
```

### Adding an affix action to a entry

Certain entries support "affix actions", which are buttons that can be placed before or after its content. The following entries support affix actions:

- [Text entry](entries/text-entry)

To define an affix action, you can pass it to either `prefixAction()` or `suffixAction()`:

```php
use App\Models\Product;
use Filament\Infolists\Components\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('cost')
    ->prefix('€')
    ->suffixAction(
        Action::make('copyCostToPrice')
            ->icon('heroicon-m-clipboard')
            ->requiresConfirmation()
            ->action(function (Product $record) {
                $record->price = $record->cost;
                $record->save();
            })
    )
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/actions/suffix" alt="Text entry with suffix action" version="3.x" />

#### Passing multiple affix actions to a entry

You may pass multiple affix actions to an entry by passing them in an array to either `prefixActions()` or `suffixActions()`. Either method can be used, or both at once, Filament will render all the registered actions in order:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('cost')
    ->prefix('€')
    ->prefixActions([
        Action::make('...'),
        Action::make('...'),
        Action::make('...'),
    ])
    ->suffixActions([
        Action::make('...'),
        Action::make('...'),
    ])
```

### Adding a hint action to an entry

All entries support "hint actions", which are rendered aside the entry's [hint](entries/getting-started#adding-a-hint-next-to-the-label). To add a hint action to a entry, you may pass it to `hintAction()`:

```php
use App\Models\Product;
use Filament\Infolists\Components\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('cost')
    ->prefix('€')
    ->hintAction(
        Action::make('copyCostToPrice')
            ->icon('heroicon-m-clipboard')
            ->requiresConfirmation()
            ->action(function (Product $record) {
                $record->price = $record->cost;
                $record->save();
            })
    )
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/entries/actions/hint" alt="Text entry with hint action" version="3.x" />

#### Passing multiple hint actions to a entry

You may pass multiple hint actions to a entry by passing them in an array to `hintActions()`. Filament will render all the registered actions in order:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;

TextEntry::make('cost')
    ->prefix('€')
    ->hintActions([
        Action::make('...'),
        Action::make('...'),
        Action::make('...'),
    ])
```

### Adding an action to a custom infolist component

If you wish to render an action within a custom infolist component, `ViewEntry` object, or `View` component object, you may do so using the `registerActions()` method:

```php
use App\Models\Post;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Infolists\Components\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Infolists\Components\ViewEntry;
use Filament\Infolists\Set;

ViewEntry::make('status')
    ->view('filament.infolists.entries.status-switcher')
    ->registerActions([
        Action::make('createStatus')
            ->form([
                TextInput::make('name')
                    ->required(),
            ])
            ->icon('heroicon-m-plus')
            ->action(function (array $data, Post $record) {
                $record->status()->create($data);
            }),
    ])
```

Now, to render the action in the view of the custom component, you need to call `$getAction()`, passing the name of the action you registered:

```blade
<div>
    <select></select>
    
    {{ $getAction('createStatus') }}
</div>
```

### Adding "anonymous" actions to an infolist without attaching them to a component

You may use an `Actions` component to render a set of actions anywhere in the infolist, avoiding the need to register them to any particular component:

```php
use App\Actions\Star;
use App\Actions\ResetStars;
use Filament\Infolists\Components\Actions;
use Filament\Infolists\Components\Actions\Action;

Actions::make([
    Action::make('star')
        ->icon('heroicon-m-star')
        ->requiresConfirmation()
        ->action(function (Star $star) {
            $star();
        }),
    Action::make('resetStars')
        ->icon('heroicon-m-x-mark')
        ->color('danger')
        ->requiresConfirmation()
        ->action(function (ResetStars $resetStars) {
            $resetStars();
        }),
]),
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/layout/actions/anonymous/simple" alt="Anonymous actions" version="3.x" />

#### Making the independent infolist actions consume the full width of the infolist

You can stretch the independent infolist actions to consume the full width of the infolist using `fullWidth()`:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\Actions;

Actions::make([
    // ...
])->fullWidth(),
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/layout/actions/anonymous/full-width" alt="Anonymous actions consuming the full width" version="3.x" />

#### Controlling the horizontal alignment of independent infolist actions

Independent infolist actions are aligned to the start of the component by default. You may change this by passing `Alignment::Center` or `Alignment::End` to `alignment()`:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\Actions;
use Filament\Support\Enums\Alignment;

Actions::make([
    // ...
])->alignment(Alignment::Center),
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/layout/actions/anonymous/horizontally-aligned-center" alt="Anonymous actions horizontally aligned to the center" version="3.x" />

#### Controlling the vertical alignment of independent infolist actions

Independent infolist actions are vertically aligned to the start of the component by default. You may change this by passing `Alignment::Center` or `Alignment::End` to `verticalAlignment()`:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\Actions;
use Filament\Support\Enums\VerticalAlignment;

Actions::make([
    // ...
])->verticalAlignment(VerticalAlignment::End),
```

<AutoScreenshot name="infolists/layout/actions/anonymous/vertically-aligned-end" alt="Anonymous actions vertically aligned to the end" version="3.x" />

## Inserting Livewire components into an infolist

You may insert a Livewire component directly into an infolist:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\Livewire;
use App\Livewire\Foo;

Livewire::make(Foo::class)
```

If you are rendering multiple of the same Livewire component, please make sure to pass a unique `key()` to each:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\Livewire;
use App\Livewire\Foo;

Livewire::make(Foo::class)
    ->key('foo-first')

Livewire::make(Foo::class)
    ->key('foo-second')

Livewire::make(Foo::class)
    ->key('foo-third')
```

### Passing parameters to a Livewire component

You can pass an array of parameters to a Livewire component:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\Livewire;
use App\Livewire\Foo;

Livewire::make(Foo::class, ['bar' => 'baz'])
```

Now, those parameters will be passed to the Livewire component's `mount()` method:

```php
class Foo extends Component
{
    public function mount(string $bar): void
    {       
        // ...
    }
}
```

Alternatively, they will be available as public properties on the Livewire component:

```php
class Foo extends Component
{
    public string $bar;
}
```

#### Accessing the current record in the Livewire component

You can access the current record in the Livewire component using the `$record` parameter in the `mount()` method, or the `$record` property:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Foo extends Component
{
    public function mount(Model $record): void
    {       
        // ...
    }
    
    // or
    
    public Model $record;
}
```

### Lazy loading a Livewire component

You may allow the component to [lazily load](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/lazy#rendering-placeholder-html) using the `lazy()` method:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\Livewire;
use App\Livewire\Foo;

Livewire::make(Foo::class)->lazy()       
```

# Documentation for infolists. File: 07-adding-an-infolist-to-a-livewire-component.md
---
title: Adding an infolist to a Livewire component
---

## Setting up the Livewire component

First, generate a new Livewire component:

```bash
php artisan make:livewire ViewProduct
```

Then, render your Livewire component on the page:

```blade
@livewire('view-product')
```

Alternatively, you can use a full-page Livewire component:

```php
use App\Livewire\ViewProduct;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

Route::get('products/{product}', ViewProduct::class);
```

You must use the `InteractsWithInfolists` and `InteractsWithForms` traits, and implement the `HasInfolists` and `HasForms` interfaces on your Livewire component class:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Concerns\InteractsWithForms;
use Filament\Forms\Contracts\HasForms;
use Filament\Infolists\Concerns\InteractsWithInfolists;
use Filament\Infolists\Contracts\HasInfolists;
use Livewire\Component;

class ViewProduct extends Component implements HasForms, HasInfolists
{
    use InteractsWithInfolists;
    use InteractsWithForms;

    // ...
}
```

## Adding the infolist

Next, add a method to the Livewire component which accepts an `$infolist` object, modifies it, and returns it:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Infolist;

public function productInfolist(Infolist $infolist): Infolist
{
    return $infolist
        ->record($this->product)
        ->schema([
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

Finally, render the infolist in the Livewire component's view:

```blade
{{ $this->productInfolist }}
```

## Passing data to the infolist

You can pass data to the infolist in two ways:

Either pass an Eloquent model instance to the `record()` method of the infolist, to automatically map all the model attributes and relationships to the entries in the infolist's schema:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;
use Filament\Infolists\Infolist;

public function productInfolist(Infolist $infolist): Infolist
{
    return $infolist
        ->record($this->product)
        ->schema([
            TextEntry::make('name'),
            TextEntry::make('category.name'),
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

Alternatively, you can pass an array of data to the `state()` method of the infolist, to manually map the data to the entries in the infolist's schema:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Components\TextEntry;
use Filament\Infolists\Infolist;

public function productInfolist(Infolist $infolist): Infolist
{
    return $infolist
        ->state([
            'name' => 'MacBook Pro',
            'category' => [
                'name' => 'Laptops',
            ],
            // ...
        ])
        ->schema([
            TextEntry::make('name'),
            TextEntry::make('category.name'),
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

# Documentation for infolists. File: 08-testing.md

title: Testing
---

## Overview

All examples in this guide will be written using [Pest](https://pestphp.com). To use Pest's Livewire plugin for testing, you can follow the installation instructions in the Pest documentation on plugins: [Livewire plugin for Pest](https://pestphp.com/docs/plugins#livewire). However, you can easily adapt this to PHPUnit.

Since the Infolist Builder works on Livewire components, you can use the [Livewire testing helpers](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/testing). However, we have custom testing helpers that you can use with infolists:

## Actions

You can call an action by passing its infolist component key, and then the name of the action to `callInfolistAction()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can send invoices', function () {
    $invoice = Invoice::factory()->create();

    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])
        ->callInfolistAction('customer', 'send', infolistName: 'infolist');

    expect($invoice->refresh())
        ->isSent()->toBeTrue();
});
```

To pass an array of data into an action, use the `data` parameter:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can send invoices', function () {
    $invoice = Invoice::factory()->create();

    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])
        ->callInfolistAction('customer', 'send', data: [
            'email' => $email = fake()->email(),
        ])
        ->assertHasNoInfolistActionErrors();

    expect($invoice->refresh())
        ->isSent()->toBeTrue()
        ->recipient_email->toBe($email);
});
```

If you ever need to only set an action's data without immediately calling it, you can use `setInfolistActionData()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can send invoices', function () {
    $invoice = Invoice::factory()->create();

    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])
        ->mountInfolistAction('customer', 'send')
        ->setInfolistActionData([
            'email' => $email = fake()->email(),
        ])
});
```

### Execution

To check if an action has been halted, you can use `assertInfolistActionHalted()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('stops sending if invoice has no email address', function () {
    $invoice = Invoice::factory(['email' => null])->create();

    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])
        ->callInfolistAction('customer', 'send')
        ->assertInfolistActionHalted('customer', 'send');
});
```

### Errors

`assertHasNoInfolistActionErrors()` is used to assert that no validation errors occurred when submitting the action form.

To check if a validation error has occurred with the data, use `assertHasInfolistActionErrors()`, similar to `assertHasErrors()` in Livewire:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can validate invoice recipient email', function () {
    $invoice = Invoice::factory()->create();

    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])
        ->callInfolistAction('customer', 'send', data: [
            'email' => Str::random(),
        ])
        ->assertHasInfolistActionErrors(['email' => ['email']]);
});
```

To check if an action is pre-filled with data, you can use the `assertInfolistActionDataSet()` method:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can send invoices to the primary contact by default', function () {
    $invoice = Invoice::factory()->create();
    $recipientEmail = $invoice->company->primaryContact->email;

    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])
        ->mountInfolistAction('customer', 'send')
        ->assertInfolistActionDataSet([
            'email' => $recipientEmail,
        ])
        ->callMountedInfolistAction()
        ->assertHasNoInfolistActionErrors();
        
    expect($invoice->refresh())
        ->isSent()->toBeTrue()
        ->recipient_email->toBe($recipientEmail);
});
```

### Action state

To ensure that an action exists or doesn't in an infolist, you can use the `assertInfolistActionExists()` or  `assertInfolistActionDoesNotExist()` method:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can send but not unsend invoices', function () {
    $invoice = Invoice::factory()->create();

    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])
        ->assertInfolistActionExists('customer', 'send')
        ->assertInfolistActionDoesNotExist('customer', 'unsend');
});
```

To ensure an action is hidden or visible for a user, you can use the `assertInfolistActionHidden()` or `assertInfolistActionVisible()` methods:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can only print customers', function () {
    $invoice = Invoice::factory()->create();

    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])
        ->assertInfolistActionHidden('customer', 'send')
        ->assertInfolistActionVisible('customer', 'print');
});
```

To ensure an action is enabled or disabled for a user, you can use the `assertInfolistActionEnabled()` or `assertInfolistActionDisabled()` methods:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can only print a customer for a sent invoice', function () {
    $invoice = Invoice::factory()->create();

    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])
        ->assertInfolistActionDisabled('customer', 'send')
        ->assertInfolistActionEnabled('customer', 'print');
});
```

To check if an action is hidden to a user, you can use the `assertInfolistActionHidden()` method:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can not send invoices', function () {
    $invoice = Invoice::factory()->create();

    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])
        ->assertInfolistActionHidden('customer', 'send');
});
```

### Button appearance

To ensure an action has the correct label, you can use `assertInfolistActionHasLabel()` and `assertInfolistActionDoesNotHaveLabel()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('send action has correct label', function () {
    $invoice = Invoice::factory()->create();

    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])
        ->assertInfolistActionHasLabel('customer', 'send', 'Email Invoice')
        ->assertInfolistActionDoesNotHaveLabel('customer', 'send', 'Send');
});
```

To ensure an action's button is showing the correct icon, you can use `assertInfolistActionHasIcon()` or `assertInfolistActionDoesNotHaveIcon()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('when enabled the send button has correct icon', function () {
    $invoice = Invoice::factory()->create();

    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])
        ->assertInfolistActionEnabled('customer', 'send')
        ->assertInfolistActionHasIcon('customer', 'send', 'envelope-open')
        ->assertInfolistActionDoesNotHaveIcon('customer', 'send', 'envelope');
});
```

To ensure that an action's button is displaying the right color, you can use `assertInfolistActionHasColor()` or `assertInfolistActionDoesNotHaveColor()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('actions display proper colors', function () {
    $invoice = Invoice::factory()->create();

    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])
        ->assertInfolistActionHasColor('customer', 'delete', 'danger')
        ->assertInfolistActionDoesNotHaveColor('customer', 'print', 'danger');
});
```

### URL

To ensure an action has the correct URL, you can use `assertInfolistActionHasUrl()`, `assertInfolistActionDoesNotHaveUrl()`, `assertInfolistActionShouldOpenUrlInNewTab()`, and `assertInfolistActionShouldNotOpenUrlInNewTab()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('links to the correct Filament sites', function () {
    $invoice = Invoice::factory()->create();

    livewire(EditInvoice::class, [
        'invoice' => $invoice,
    ])
        ->assertInfolistActionHasUrl('customer', 'filament', 'https://filamentphp.com/')
        ->assertInfolistActionDoesNotHaveUrl('customer', 'filament', 'https://github.com/filamentphp/filament')
        ->assertInfolistActionShouldOpenUrlInNewTab('customer', 'filament')
        ->assertInfolistActionShouldNotOpenUrlInNewTab('customer', 'github');
});
```

**The Notifications package is pre-installed with the [Panel Builder](/docs/panels).** This guide is for using the Notifications package in a custom TALL Stack application (Tailwind, Alpine, Livewire, Laravel).

## Requirements

Filament requires the following to run:

- PHP 8.1+
- Laravel v10.0+
- Livewire v3.0+
- Tailwind v3.0+ [(Using Tailwind v4?)](#installing-tailwind-css)

Require the Notifications package using Composer:

```bash
composer require filament/notifications:"^3.3" -W
```

## New Laravel projects

To quickly get started with Filament in a new Laravel project, run the following commands to install [Livewire](https://livewire.laravel.com), [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com):

> Since these commands will overwrite existing files in your application, only run this in a new Laravel project!

```bash
php artisan filament:install --scaffold --notifications

npm install

npm run dev
```

## Existing Laravel projects

Run the following command to install the Notifications package assets:

```bash
php artisan filament:install --notifications
```

### Installing Tailwind CSS

> Filament uses Tailwind CSS v3 for styling. If your project uses Tailwind CSS v4, you will unfortunately need to downgrade it to v3 to use Filament. Filament v3 can't support Tailwind CSS v4 since it introduces breaking changes. Filament v4 will support Tailwind CSS v4.

Run the following command to install Tailwind CSS with the Tailwind Forms and Typography plugins:

```bash
npm install tailwindcss@3 @tailwindcss/forms @tailwindcss/typography postcss postcss-nesting autoprefixer --save-dev
```

Create a new `tailwind.config.js` file and add the Filament `preset` *(includes the Filament color scheme and the required Tailwind plugins)*:

```js
import preset from './vendor/filament/support/tailwind.config.preset'

export default {
    presets: [preset],
    content: [
        './app/Filament/**/*.php',
        './resources/views/filament/**/*.blade.php',
        './vendor/filament/**/*.blade.php',
    ],
}
```

### Configuring styles

Add Tailwind's CSS layers to your `resources/css/app.css`:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
@tailwind variants;
```

Create a `postcss.config.js` file in the root of your project and register Tailwind CSS, PostCSS Nesting and Autoprefixer as plugins:

```js
export default {
    plugins: {
        'tailwindcss/nesting': 'postcss-nesting',
        tailwindcss: {},
        autoprefixer: {},
    },
}
```

### Automatically refreshing the browser
You may also want to update your `vite.config.js` file to refresh the page automatically when Livewire components are updated:

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import laravel, { refreshPaths } from 'laravel-vite-plugin'

export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [
        laravel({
            input: ['resources/css/app.css', 'resources/js/app.js'],
            refresh: [
                ...refreshPaths,
                'app/Livewire/**',
            ],
        }),
    ],
})
```

### Compiling assets

Compile your new CSS and Javascript assets using `npm run dev`.

### Configuring your layout

Create a new `resources/views/components/layouts/app.blade.php` layout file for Livewire components:

```blade
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="{{ str_replace('_', '-', app()->getLocale()) }}">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">

        <meta name="application-name" content="{{ config('app.name') }}">
        <meta name="csrf-token" content="{{ csrf_token() }}">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

        <title>{{ config('app.name') }}</title>

        <style>
            [x-cloak] {
                display: none !important;
            }
        </style>

        @filamentStyles
        @vite('resources/css/app.css')
    </head>

    <body class="antialiased">
        {{ $slot }}

        @livewire('notifications')

        @filamentScripts
        @vite('resources/js/app.js')
    </body>
</html>
```

## Publishing configuration

You can publish the package configuration using the following command (optional):

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=filament-config
```

## Upgrading

> Upgrading from Filament v2? Please review the [upgrade guide](upgrade-guide).

Filament automatically upgrades to the latest non-breaking version when you run `composer update`. After any updates, all Laravel caches need to be cleared, and frontend assets need to be republished. You can do this all at once using the `filament:upgrade` command, which should have been added to your `composer.json` file when you ran `filament:install` the first time:

```json
"post-autoload-dump": [
    // ...
    "@php artisan filament:upgrade"
],
```

Please note that `filament:upgrade` does not actually handle the update process, as Composer does that already. If you're upgrading manually without a `post-autoload-dump` hook, you can run the command yourself:

```bash
composer update

php artisan filament:upgrade
```

title: Sending notifications
---
import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"

## Overview

> To start, make sure the package is [installed](installation) - `@livewire('notifications')` should be in your Blade layout somewhere.

Notifications are sent using a `Notification` object that's constructed through a fluent API. Calling the `send()` method on the `Notification` object will dispatch the notification and display it in your application. As the session is used to flash notifications, they can be sent from anywhere in your code, including JavaScript, not just Livewire components.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Livewire;

use Filament\Notifications\Notification;
use Livewire\Component;

class EditPost extends Component
{
    public function save(): void
    {
        // ...

        Notification::make()
            ->title('Saved successfully')
            ->success()
            ->send();
    }
}
```

<AutoScreenshot name="notifications/success" alt="Success notification" version="3.x" />

## Setting a title

The main message of the notification is shown in the title. You can set the title as follows:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

Notification::make()
    ->title('Saved successfully')
    ->send();
```

The title text can contain basic, safe HTML elements. To generate safe HTML with Markdown, you can use the [`Str::markdown()` helper](https://laravel.com/docs/strings#method-str-markdown): `title(Str::markdown('Saved **successfully**'))`

Or with JavaScript:

```js
new FilamentNotification()
    .title('Saved successfully')
    .send()
```

## Setting an icon

Optionally, a notification can have an [icon](https://blade-ui-kit.com/blade-icons?set=1#search) that's displayed in front of its content. You may also set a color for the icon, which is gray by default:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

Notification::make()
    ->title('Saved successfully')
    ->icon('heroicon-o-document-text')
    ->iconColor('success')
    ->send();
```

Or with JavaScript:

```js
new FilamentNotification()
    .title('Saved successfully')
    .icon('heroicon-o-document-text')
    .iconColor('success')
    .send()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="notifications/icon" alt="Notification with icon" version="3.x" />

Notifications often have a status like `success`, `warning`, `danger` or `info`. Instead of manually setting the corresponding icons and colors, there's a `status()` method which you can pass the status. You may also use the dedicated `success()`, `warning()`, `danger()` and `info()` methods instead. So, cleaning up the above example would look like this:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

Notification::make()
    ->title('Saved successfully')
    ->success()
    ->send();
```

Or with JavaScript:

```js
new FilamentNotification()
    .title('Saved successfully')
    .success()
    .send()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="notifications/statuses" alt="Notifications with various statuses" version="3.x" />

## Setting a background color

Notifications have no background color by default. You may want to provide additional context to your notification by setting a color as follows:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

Notification::make()
    ->title('Saved successfully')
    ->color('success')
    ->send();
```

Or with JavaScript:

```js
new FilamentNotification()
    .title('Saved successfully')
    .color('success')
    .send()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="notifications/color" alt="Notification with background color" version="3.x" />

## Setting a duration

By default, notifications are shown for 6 seconds before they're automatically closed. You may specify a custom duration value in milliseconds as follows:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

Notification::make()
    ->title('Saved successfully')
    ->success()
    ->duration(5000)
    ->send();
```

Or with JavaScript:

```js
new FilamentNotification()
    .title('Saved successfully')
    .success()
    .duration(5000)
    .send()
```

If you prefer setting a duration in seconds instead of milliseconds, you can do so:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

Notification::make()
    ->title('Saved successfully')
    ->success()
    ->seconds(5)
    ->send();
```

Or with JavaScript:

```js
new FilamentNotification()
    .title('Saved successfully')
    .success()
    .seconds(5)
    .send()
```

You might want some notifications to not automatically close and require the user to close them manually. This can be achieved by making the notification persistent:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

Notification::make()
    ->title('Saved successfully')
    ->success()
    ->persistent()
    ->send();
```

Or with JavaScript:

```js
new FilamentNotification()
    .title('Saved successfully')
    .success()
    .persistent()
    .send()
```

## Setting body text

Additional notification text can be shown in the `body()`:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

Notification::make()
    ->title('Saved successfully')
    ->success()
    ->body('Changes to the post have been saved.')
    ->send();
```

The body text can contain basic, safe HTML elements. To generate safe HTML with Markdown, you can use the [`Str::markdown()` helper](https://laravel.com/docs/strings#method-str-markdown): `body(Str::markdown('Changes to the **post** have been saved.'))`

Or with JavaScript:

```js
new FilamentNotification()
    .title('Saved successfully')
    .success()
    .body('Changes to the post have been saved.')
    .send()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="notifications/body" alt="Notification with body text" version="3.x" />

## Adding actions to notifications

Notifications support [Actions](../actions/trigger-button), which are buttons that render below the content of the notification. They can open a URL or dispatch a Livewire event. Actions can be defined as follows:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

Notification::make()
    ->title('Saved successfully')
    ->success()
    ->body('Changes to the post have been saved.')
    ->actions([
        Action::make('view')
            ->button(),
        Action::make('undo')
            ->color('gray'),
    ])
    ->send();
```

Or with JavaScript:

```js
new FilamentNotification()
    .title('Saved successfully')
    .success()
    .body('Changes to the post have been saved.')
    .actions([
        new FilamentNotificationAction('view')
            .button(),
        new FilamentNotificationAction('undo')
            .color('gray'),
    ])
    .send()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="notifications/actions" alt="Notification with actions" version="3.x" />

You can learn more about how to style action buttons [here](../actions/trigger-button).

### Opening URLs from notification actions

You can open a URL, optionally in a new tab, when clicking on an action:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

Notification::make()
    ->title('Saved successfully')
    ->success()
    ->body('Changes to the post have been saved.')
    ->actions([
        Action::make('view')
            ->button()
            ->url(route('posts.show', $post), shouldOpenInNewTab: true),
        Action::make('undo')
            ->color('gray'),
    ])
    ->send();
```

Or with JavaScript:

```js
new FilamentNotification()
    .title('Saved successfully')
    .success()
    .body('Changes to the post have been saved.')
    .actions([
        new FilamentNotificationAction('view')
            .button()
            .url('/view')
            .openUrlInNewTab(),
        new FilamentNotificationAction('undo')
            .color('gray'),
    ])
    .send()
```

### Dispatching Livewire events from notification actions

Sometimes you want to execute additional code when a notification action is clicked. This can be achieved by setting a Livewire event which should be dispatched on clicking the action. You may optionally pass an array of data, which will be available as parameters in the event listener on your Livewire component:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

Notification::make()
    ->title('Saved successfully')
    ->success()
    ->body('Changes to the post have been saved.')
    ->actions([
        Action::make('view')
            ->button()
            ->url(route('posts.show', $post), shouldOpenInNewTab: true),
        Action::make('undo')
            ->color('gray')
            ->dispatch('undoEditingPost', [$post->id]),
    ])
    ->send();
```

You can also `dispatchSelf` and `dispatchTo`:

```php
Action::make('undo')
    ->color('gray')
    ->dispatchSelf('undoEditingPost', [$post->id])

Action::make('undo')
    ->color('gray')
    ->dispatchTo('another_component', 'undoEditingPost', [$post->id])
```

Or with JavaScript:

```js
new FilamentNotification()
    .title('Saved successfully')
    .success()
    .body('Changes to the post have been saved.')
    .actions([
        new FilamentNotificationAction('view')
            .button()
            .url('/view')
            .openUrlInNewTab(),
        new FilamentNotificationAction('undo')
            .color('gray')
            .dispatch('undoEditingPost'),
    ])
    .send()
```

Similarly, `dispatchSelf` and `dispatchTo` are also available:

```js
new FilamentNotificationAction('undo')
    .color('gray')
    .dispatchSelf('undoEditingPost')

new FilamentNotificationAction('undo')
    .color('gray')
    .dispatchTo('another_component', 'undoEditingPost')
```

### Closing notifications from actions

After opening a URL or dispatching an event from your action, you may want to close the notification right away:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

Notification::make()
    ->title('Saved successfully')
    ->success()
    ->body('Changes to the post have been saved.')
    ->actions([
        Action::make('view')
            ->button()
            ->url(route('posts.show', $post), shouldOpenInNewTab: true),
        Action::make('undo')
            ->color('gray')
            ->dispatch('undoEditingPost', [$post->id])
            ->close(),
    ])
    ->send();
```

Or with JavaScript:

```js
new FilamentNotification()
    .title('Saved successfully')
    .success()
    .body('Changes to the post have been saved.')
    .actions([
        new FilamentNotificationAction('view')
            .button()
            .url('/view')
            .openUrlInNewTab(),
        new FilamentNotificationAction('undo')
            .color('gray')
            .dispatch('undoEditingPost')
            .close(),
    ])
    .send()
```

## Using the JavaScript objects

The JavaScript objects (`FilamentNotification` and `FilamentNotificationAction`) are assigned to `window.FilamentNotification` and `window.FilamentNotificationAction`, so they are available in on-page scripts.

You may also import them in a bundled JavaScript file:

```js
import { Notification, NotificationAction } from '../../vendor/filament/notifications/dist/index.js'

// ...
```

## Closing a notification with JavaScript

Once a notification has been sent, you can close it on demand by dispatching a browser event on the window called `close-notification`.

The event needs to contain the ID of the notification you sent. To get the ID, you can use the `getId()` method on the `Notification` object:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

$notification = Notification::make()
    ->title('Hello')
    ->persistent()
    ->send()

$notificationId = $notification->getId()
```

To close the notification, you can dispatch the event from Livewire:

```php
$this->dispatch('close-notification', id: $notificationId);
```

Or from JavaScript, in this case Alpine.js:

```blade
<button x-on:click="$dispatch('close-notification', { id: notificationId })" type="button">
    Close Notification
</button>
```

If you are able to retrieve the notification ID, persist it, and then use it to close the notification, that is the recommended approach, as IDs are generated uniquely, and you will not risk closing the wrong notification. However, if it is not possible to persist the random ID, you can pass in a custom ID when sending the notification:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

Notification::make('greeting')
    ->title('Hello')
    ->persistent()
    ->send()
```

In this case, you can close the notification by dispatching the event with the custom ID:

```blade
<button x-on:click="$dispatch('close-notification', { id: 'greeting' })" type="button">
    Close Notification
</button>
```

Please be aware that if you send multiple notifications with the same ID, you may experience unexpected side effects, so random IDs are recommended.

# Documentation for notifications. File: 03-database-notifications.md
---
title: Database notifications
---
import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"

<AutoScreenshot name="notifications/database" alt="Database notifications" version="3.x" />

## Setting up the notifications database table

Before we start, make sure that the [Laravel notifications table](https://laravel.com/docs/notifications#database-prerequisites) is added to your database:

```bash
# Laravel 11 and higher
php artisan make:notifications-table

# Laravel 10
php artisan notifications:table
```

> If you're using PostgreSQL, make sure that the `data` column in the migration is using `json()`: `$table->json('data')`.

> If you're using UUIDs for your `User` model, make sure that your `notifiable` column is using `uuidMorphs()`: `$table->uuidMorphs('notifiable')`.

## Rendering the database notifications modal

> If you want to add database notifications to a panel, [follow this part of the guide](#adding-the-database-notifications-modal-to-a-panel).

If you'd like to render the database notifications modal outside of the [Panel Builder](../panels), you'll need to add a new Livewire component to your Blade layout:

```blade
@livewire('database-notifications')
```

To open the modal, you must have a "trigger" button in your view. Create a new trigger button component in your app, for instance at `/resources/views/filament/notifications/database-notifications-trigger.blade.php`:

```blade
<button type="button">
    Notifications ({{ $unreadNotificationsCount }} unread)
</button>
```

`$unreadNotificationsCount` is a variable automatically passed to this view, which provides it with a real-time count of unread notifications the user has.

In the service provider, point to this new trigger view:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Livewire\DatabaseNotifications;

DatabaseNotifications::trigger('filament.notifications.database-notifications-trigger');
```

Now, click on the trigger button that is rendered in your view. A modal should appear containing your database notifications when clicked!

### Adding the database notifications modal to a panel

You can enable database notifications in a panel's [configuration](../panels/configuration):

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->databaseNotifications();
}
```

To learn more, visit the [Panel Builder documentation](../panels/notifications).

## Sending database notifications

There are several ways to send database notifications, depending on which one suits you best.

You may use our fluent API:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

$recipient = auth()->user();

Notification::make()
    ->title('Saved successfully')
    ->sendToDatabase($recipient);
```

Or, use the `notify()` method:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

$recipient = auth()->user();

$recipient->notify(
    Notification::make()
        ->title('Saved successfully')
        ->toDatabase(),
);
```

> Laravel sends database notifications using the queue. Ensure your queue is running in order to receive the notifications.

Alternatively, use a traditional [Laravel notification class](https://laravel.com/docs/notifications#generating-notifications) by returning the notification from the `toDatabase()` method:

```php
use App\Models\User;
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

public function toDatabase(User $notifiable): array
{
    return Notification::make()
        ->title('Saved successfully')
        ->getDatabaseMessage();
}
```

## Receiving database notifications

Without any setup, new database notifications will only be received when the page is first loaded.

### Polling for new database notifications

Polling is the practice of periodically making a request to the server to check for new notifications. This is a good approach as the setup is simple, but some may say that it is not a scalable solution as it increases server load.

By default, Livewire polls for new notifications every 30 seconds:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Livewire\DatabaseNotifications;

DatabaseNotifications::pollingInterval('30s');
```

You may completely disable polling if you wish:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Livewire\DatabaseNotifications;

DatabaseNotifications::pollingInterval(null);
```

### Using Echo to receive new database notifications with websockets

Alternatively, the package has a native integration with [Laravel Echo](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting#client-side-installation). Make sure Echo is installed, as well as a [server-side websockets integration](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting#server-side-installation) like Pusher.

Once websockets are set up, you can automatically dispatch a `DatabaseNotificationsSent` event by setting the `isEventDispatched` parameter to `true` when sending the notification. This will trigger the immediate fetching of new notifications for the user:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

$recipient = auth()->user();

Notification::make()
    ->title('Saved successfully')
    ->sendToDatabase($recipient, isEventDispatched: true);
```

## Marking database notifications as read

There is a button at the top of the modal to mark all notifications as read at once. You may also add [Actions](sending-notifications#adding-actions-to-notifications) to notifications, which you can use to mark individual notifications as read. To do this, use the `markAsRead()` method on the action:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

Notification::make()
    ->title('Saved successfully')
    ->success()
    ->body('Changes to the post have been saved.')
    ->actions([
        Action::make('view')
            ->button()
            ->markAsRead(),
    ])
    ->send();
```

Alternatively, you may use the `markAsUnread()` method to mark a notification as unread:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

Notification::make()
    ->title('Saved successfully')
    ->success()
    ->body('Changes to the post have been saved.')
    ->actions([
        Action::make('markAsUnread')
            ->button()
            ->markAsUnread(),
    ])
    ->send();
```

## Opening the database notifications modal

Instead of rendering the trigger button as described above, you can always open the database notifications modal from anywhere by dispatching an `open-modal` browser event:

```blade
<button
    x-data="{}"
    x-on:click="$dispatch('open-modal', { id: 'database-notifications' })"
    type="button"
>
    Notifications
</button>
```

# Documentation for notifications. File: 04-broadcast-notifications.md

title: Broadcast notifications
---

## Overview

> To start, make sure the package is [installed](installation) - `@livewire('notifications')` should be in your Blade layout somewhere.

By default, Filament will send flash notifications via the Laravel session. However, you may wish that your notifications are "broadcast" to a user in real-time, instead. This could be used to send a temporary success notification from a queued job after it has finished processing.

We have a native integration with [Laravel Echo](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting#client-side-installation). Make sure Echo is installed, as well as a [server-side websockets integration](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting#server-side-installation) like Pusher.

## Sending broadcast notifications

There are several ways to send broadcast notifications, depending on which one suits you best.

You may use our fluent API:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

$recipient = auth()->user();

Notification::make()
    ->title('Saved successfully')
    ->broadcast($recipient);
```

Or, use the `notify()` method:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

$recipient = auth()->user();

$recipient->notify(
    Notification::make()
        ->title('Saved successfully')
        ->toBroadcast(),
)
```

Alternatively, use a traditional [Laravel notification class](https://laravel.com/docs/notifications#generating-notifications) by returning the notification from the `toBroadcast()` method:

```php
use App\Models\User;
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;
use Illuminate\Notifications\Messages\BroadcastMessage;

title: Customizing notifications
---

## Overview

Notifications come fully styled out of the box. However, if you want to apply your own styling or use a custom view to render notifications, there are multiple options.

## Styling notifications

Notifications have dedicated CSS classes you can hook into to apply your own styling. Open the inspector in your browser to find out which classes you need to target.

## Positioning notifications

You can configure the alignment of the notifications in a service provider or middleware, by calling `Notifications::alignment()` and `Notifications::verticalAlignment()`. You can pass `Alignment::Start`, `Alignment::Center`, `Alignment::End`, `VerticalAlignment::Start`, `VerticalAlignment::Center` or `VerticalAlignment::End`:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Livewire\Notifications;
use Filament\Support\Enums\Alignment;
use Filament\Support\Enums\VerticalAlignment;

Notifications::alignment(Alignment::Start);
Notifications::verticalAlignment(VerticalAlignment::End);
```

## Using a custom notification view

If your desired customization can't be achieved using the CSS classes above, you can create a custom view to render the notification. To configure the notification view, call the static `configureUsing()` method inside a service provider's `boot()` method and specify the view to use:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

Notification::configureUsing(function (Notification $notification): void {
    $notification->view('filament.notifications.notification');
});
```

Next, create the view, in this example `resources/views/filament/notifications/notification.blade.php`. The view should use the package's base notification component for the notification functionality and pass the available `$notification` variable through the `notification` attribute. This is the bare minimum required to create your own notification view:

```blade
<x-filament-notifications::notification :notification="$notification">
    {{-- Notification content --}}
</x-filament-notifications::notification>
```

Getters for all notification properties will be available in the view. So, a custom notification view might look like this:

```blade
<x-filament-notifications::notification
    :notification="$notification"
    class="flex w-80 rounded-lg transition duration-200"
    x-transition:enter-start="opacity-0"
    x-transition:leave-end="opacity-0"
>
    <h4>
        {{ $getTitle() }}
    </h4>

    <p>
        {{ $getDate() }}
    </p>

    <p>
        {{ $getBody() }}
    </p>

    <span x-on:click="close">
        Close
    </span>
</x-filament-notifications::notification>
```

## Using a custom notification object

Maybe your notifications require additional functionality that's not defined in the package's `Notification` class. Then you can create your own `Notification` class, which extends the package's `Notification` class. For example, your notification design might need a size property.

Your custom `Notification` class in `app/Notifications/Notification.php` might contain:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Notifications;

use Filament\Notifications\Notification as BaseNotification;

class Notification extends BaseNotification
{
    protected string $size = 'md';

    public function toArray(): array
    {
        return [
            ...parent::toArray(),
            'size' => $this->getSize(),
        ];
    }

    public static function fromArray(array $data): static
    {
        return parent::fromArray($data)->size($data['size']);
    }

    public function size(string $size): static
    {
        $this->size = $size;

        return $this;
    }

    public function getSize(): string
    {
        return $this->size;
    }
}
```

Next, you should bind your custom `Notification` class into the container inside a service provider's `register()` method:

```php
use App\Notifications\Notification;
use Filament\Notifications\Notification as BaseNotification;

$this->app->bind(BaseNotification::class, Notification::class);
```

You can now use your custom `Notification` class in the same way as you would with the default `Notification` object.

# Documentation for notifications. File: 06-testing.md
---
title: Testing
---

## Overview

All examples in this guide will be written using [Pest](https://pestphp.com). To use Pest's Livewire plugin for testing, you can follow the installation instructions in the Pest documentation on plugins: [Livewire plugin for Pest](https://pestphp.com/docs/plugins#livewire). However, you can easily adapt this to PHPUnit.

## Testing session notifications

To check if a notification was sent using the session, use the `assertNotified()` helper:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('sends a notification', function () {
    livewire(CreatePost::class)
        ->assertNotified();
});
```

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

it('sends a notification', function () {
    Notification::assertNotified();
});
```

```php
use function Filament\Notifications\Testing\assertNotified;

it('sends a notification', function () {
    assertNotified();
});
```

You may optionally pass a notification title to test for:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('sends a notification', function () {
    livewire(CreatePost::class)
        ->assertNotified('Unable to create post');
});
```

Or test if the exact notification was sent:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('sends a notification', function () {
    livewire(CreatePost::class)
        ->assertNotified(
            Notification::make()
                ->danger()
                ->title('Unable to create post')
                ->body('Something went wrong.'),
        );
});
```

Conversely, you can assert that a notification was not sent:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('does not send a notification', function () {
    livewire(CreatePost::class)
        ->assertNotNotified()
        // or
        ->assertNotNotified('Unable to create post')
        // or
        ->assertNotNotified(
            Notification::make()
                ->danger()
                ->title('Unable to create post')
                ->body('Something went wrong.'),
        );
```

title: Upgrading from v2.x
---

> If you see anything missing from this guide, please do not hesitate to [make a pull request](https://github.com/filamentphp/filament/edit/3.x/packages/notifications/docs/07-upgrade-guide.md) to our repository! Any help is appreciated!

## New requirements

- Laravel v10.0+
- Livewire v3.0+

Please upgrade Filament before upgrading to Livewire v3. Instructions on how to upgrade Livewire can be found [here](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/upgrading).

## Upgrading automatically

The easiest way to upgrade your app is to run the automated upgrade script. This script will automatically upgrade your application to the latest version of Filament, and make changes to your code which handle most breaking changes.

```bash
composer require filament/upgrade:"^3.2" -W --dev
vendor/bin/filament-v3
```

Make sure to carefully follow the instructions, and review the changes made by the script. You may need to make some manual changes to your code afterwards, but the script should handle most of the repetitive work for you.

Finally, you must run `php artisan filament:install` to finalize the Filament v3 installation. This command must be run for all new Filament projects.

You can now `composer remove filament/upgrade` as you don't need it anymore.

> Some plugins you're using may not be available in v3 just yet. You could temporarily remove them from your `composer.json` file until they've been upgraded, replace them with a similar plugins that are v3-compatible, wait for the plugins to be upgraded before upgrading your app, or even write PRs to help the authors upgrade them.

## Upgrading manually

After upgrading the dependency via Composer, you should execute `php artisan filament:upgrade` in order to clear any Laravel caches and publish the new frontend assets.

### High-impact changes

#### Config file renamed and combined with other Filament packages

Only one config file is now used for all Filament packages. Most configuration has been moved into other parts of the codebase, and little remains. You should use the v3 documentation as a reference when replace the configuration options you did modify. To publish the new configuration file and remove the old one, run:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=filament-config --force
rm config/notifications.php
```

#### New `@filamentScripts` and `@filamentStyles` Blade directives

The `@filamentScripts` and `@filamentStyles` Blade directives must be added to your Blade layout file/s. Since Livewire v3 no longer uses similar directives, you can replace `@livewireScripts` with `@filamentScripts`  and `@livewireStyles` with `@filamentStyles`.

#### JavaScript assets

You no longer need to import the `NotificationsAlpinePlugin` in your JavaScript files. Alpine plugins are now automatically loaded by `@filamentScripts`.

#### Heroicons have been updated to v2

The Heroicons library has been updated to v2. This means that any icons you use in your app may have changed names. You can find a list of changes [here](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/heroicons/releases/tag/v2.0.0).

### Medium-impact changes

#### Secondary color

Filament v2 had a `secondary` color for many components which was gray. All references to `secondary` should be replaced with `gray` to preserve the same appearance. This frees `secondary` to be registered to a new custom color of your choice.

#### Notification JS objects

The `Notification` JavaScript object has been renamed to `FilamentNotification` to avoid conflicts with the native browser `Notification` object. The same has been done for `NotificationAction` (now `FilamentNotificationAction`) and `NotificationActionGroup` (now `FilamentNotificationActionGroup`) for consistency.

# Documentation for panels. File: 01-installation.md
---
title: Installation
---

## Requirements

Filament requires the following to run:

- PHP 8.1+
- Laravel v10.0+
- Livewire v3.0+

## Installation

> If you are upgrading from Filament v2, please review the [upgrade guide](upgrade-guide).

Install the Filament Panel Builder by running the following commands in your Laravel project directory:

```bash
composer require filament/filament:"^3.3" -W

php artisan filament:install --panels
```

This will create and register a new [Laravel service provider](https://laravel.com/docs/providers) called `app/Providers/Filament/AdminPanelProvider.php`.

> If you get an error when accessing your panel, check that the service provider was registered in `bootstrap/providers.php` (Laravel 11 and above) or `config/app.php` (Laravel 10 and below). If not, you should manually add it.

## Create a user
You can create a new user account with the following command:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-user
```

Open `/admin` in your web browser, sign in, and start building your app!

Not sure where to start? Review the [Getting Started guide](getting-started) to learn how to build a complete Filament admin panel.

## Using other Filament packages
The Filament Panel Builder pre-installs the [Form Builder](/docs/forms), [Table Builder](/docs/tables), [Notifications](/docs/notifications), [Actions](/docs/actions), [Infolists](/docs/infolists), and [Widgets](/docs/widgets) packages. No other installation steps are required to use these packages within a panel.

## Improving Filament panel performance

### Optimizing Filament for production

To optimize Filament for production, you should run the following command in your deployment script:

```bash
php artisan filament:optimize
```

This command will [cache the Filament components](#caching-filament-components) and additionally the [Blade icons](#caching-blade-icons), which can significantly improve the performance of your Filament panels. This command is a shorthand for the commands `php artisan filament:cache-components` and `php artisan icons:cache`.

To clear the caches at once, you can run:

```bash
php artisan filament:optimize-clear
```

#### Caching Filament components

If you're not using the [`filament:optimize` command](#optimizing-filament-for-production), you may wish to consider running `php artisan filament:cache-components` in your deployment script, especially if you have large numbers of components (resources, pages, widgets, relation managers, custom Livewire components, etc.). This will create cache files in the `bootstrap/cache/filament` directory of your application, which contain indexes for each type of component. This can significantly improve the performance of Filament in some apps, as it reduces the number of files that need to be scanned and auto-discovered for components.

However, if you are actively developing your app locally, you should avoid using this command, as it will prevent any new components from being discovered until the cache is cleared or rebuilt.

You can clear the cache at any time without rebuilding it by running `php artisan filament:clear-cached-components`.

#### Caching Blade Icons

If you're not using the [`filament:optimize` command](#optimizing-filament-for-production), you may wish to consider running `php artisan icons:cache` locally, and also in your deployment script. This is because Filament uses the [Blade Icons](https://blade-ui-kit.com/blade-icons) package, which can be much more performant when cached.

### Enabling OPcache on your server

From the [Laravel Forge documentation](https://forge.laravel.com/docs/servers/php.html#opcache):

> Optimizing the PHP OPcache for production will configure OPcache to store your compiled PHP code in memory to greatly improve performance.

Please use a search engine to find the relevant OPcache setup instructions for your environment.

### Optimizing your Laravel app

You should also consider optimizing your Laravel app for production by running `php artisan optimize` in your deployment script. This will cache the configuration files and routes.

## Deploying to production

### Allowing users to access a panel

By default, all `User` models can access Filament locally. However, when deploying to production or running unit tests, you must update your `App\Models\User.php` to implement the `FilamentUser` contract — ensuring that only the correct users can access your panel:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Filament\Models\Contracts\FilamentUser;
use Filament\Panel;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;

class User extends Authenticatable implements FilamentUser
{
    // ...

    public function canAccessPanel(Panel $panel): bool
    {
        return str_ends_with($this->email, '@yourdomain.com') && $this->hasVerifiedEmail();
    }
}
```

> If you don't complete these steps, a 403 Forbidden error will be returned when accessing the app in production.

Learn more about [users](users).

### Using a production-ready storage disk

Filament has a storage disk defined in the [configuration](#publishing-configuration), which by default is set to `public`. You can set the `FILAMENT_FILESYSTEM_DISK` environment variable to change this.

The `public` disk, while great for easy local development, is not suitable for production. It does not support file visibility, so features of Filament such as [file uploads](../forms/fields/file-upload) will create public files. In production, you need to use a production-ready disk such as `s3` with a private access policy, to prevent unauthorized access to the uploaded files.

## Publishing configuration

You can publish the Filament package configuration (if needed) using the following command:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=filament-config
```

## Publishing translations

You can publish the language files for translations (if needed) with the following command:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=filament-panels-translations
```

Since this package depends on other Filament packages, you can publish the language files for those packages with the following commands:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=filament-actions-translations

php artisan vendor:publish --tag=filament-forms-translations

php artisan vendor:publish --tag=filament-infolists-translations

php artisan vendor:publish --tag=filament-notifications-translations

php artisan vendor:publish --tag=filament-tables-translations

php artisan vendor:publish --tag=filament-translations
```

## Upgrading

> Upgrading from Filament v2? Please review the [upgrade guide](upgrade-guide).

Filament automatically upgrades to the latest non-breaking version when you run `composer update`. After any updates, all Laravel caches need to be cleared, and frontend assets need to be republished. You can do this all at once using the `filament:upgrade` command, which should have been added to your `composer.json` file when you ran `filament:install` the first time:

```json
"post-autoload-dump": [
    // ...
    "@php artisan filament:upgrade"
],
```

Please note that `filament:upgrade` does not actually handle the update process, as Composer does that already. If you're upgrading manually without a `post-autoload-dump` hook, you can run the command yourself:

```bash
composer update

php artisan filament:upgrade
```

import LaracastsBanner from "@components/LaracastsBanner.astro"

## Overview

Panels are the top-level container in Filament, allowing you to build feature-rich admin panels that include pages, resources, forms, tables, notifications, actions, infolists, and widgets. All Panels include a default dashboard that can include widgets with statistics, charts, tables, and more.

<LaracastsBanner
    title="Introduction to Filament"
    description="Watch the Rapid Laravel Development with Filament series on Laracasts - it will teach you how to get started with the panel builder. Alternatively, continue reading this text-based guide."
    url="https://laracasts.com/series/rapid-laravel-development-with-filament/episodes/2"
    series="rapid-laravel-development"
/>

## Prerequisites

Before using Filament, you should be familiar with Laravel. Filament builds upon many core Laravel concepts, especially [database migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations) and [Eloquent ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent). If you're new to Laravel or need a refresher, we highly recommend completing the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), which covers the fundamentals of building Laravel apps.

## The demo project

This guide covers building a simple patient management system for a veterinary practice using Filament. It will support adding new patients (cats, dogs, or rabbits), assigning them to an owner, and recording which treatments they received. The system will have a dashboard with statistics about the types of patients and a chart showing the number of treatments administered over the past year.

## Setting up the database and models

This project needs three models and migrations: `Owner`, `Patient`, and `Treatment`. Use the following artisan commands to create these:

```bash
php artisan make:model Owner -m
php artisan make:model Patient -m
php artisan make:model Treatment -m
```

### Defining migrations

Use the following basic schemas for your database migrations:

```php

// create_owners_table
Schema::create('owners', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->id();
    $table->string('email');
    $table->string('name');
    $table->string('phone');
    $table->timestamps();
});

// create_patients_table
Schema::create('patients', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->id();
    $table->date('date_of_birth');
    $table->string('name');
    $table->foreignId('owner_id')->constrained('owners')->cascadeOnDelete();
    $table->string('type');
    $table->timestamps();
});

// create_treatments_table
Schema::create('treatments', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->id();
    $table->string('description');
    $table->text('notes')->nullable();
    $table->foreignId('patient_id')->constrained('patients')->cascadeOnDelete();
    $table->unsignedInteger('price')->nullable();
    $table->timestamps();
});
```

Run the migrations using `php artisan migrate`.

### Unguarding all models

For brevity in this guide, we will disable Laravel's [mass assignment protection](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent#mass-assignment). Filament only saves valid data to models so the models can be unguarded safely. To unguard all Laravel models at once, add `Model::unguard()` to the `boot()` method of `app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php`:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

public function boot(): void
{
    Model::unguard();
}
```

### Setting up relationships between models

Let's set up relationships between the models. For our system, pet owners can own multiple pets (patients), and patients can have many treatments:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\BelongsTo;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\HasMany;

class Owner extends Model
{
    public function patients(): HasMany
    {
        return $this->hasMany(Patient::class);
    }
}

class Patient extends Model
{
    public function owner(): BelongsTo
    {
        return $this->belongsTo(Owner::class);
    }

    public function treatments(): HasMany
    {
        return $this->hasMany(Treatment::class);
    }
}

class Treatment extends Model
{
    public function patient(): BelongsTo
    {
        return $this->belongsTo(Patient::class);
    }
}
```

## Introducing resources

In Filament, resources are static classes used to build CRUD interfaces for your Eloquent models. They describe how administrators can interact with data from your panel using tables and forms.

Since patients (pets) are the core entity in this system, let's start by creating a patient resource that enables us to build pages for creating, viewing, updating, and deleting patients.

Use the following artisan command to create a new Filament resource for the `Patient` model:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-resource Patient
```

This will create several files in the `app/Filament/Resources` directory:

```
.
+-- PatientResource.php
+-- PatientResource
|   +-- Pages
|   |   +-- CreatePatient.php
|   |   +-- EditPatient.php
|   |   +-- ListPatients.php
```

Visit `/admin/patients` in your browser and observe a new link called "Patients" in the navigation. Clicking the link will display an empty table. Let's add a form to create new patients.

### Setting up the resource form

If you open the `PatientResource.php` file, there's a `form()` method with an empty `schema([...])` array. Adding form fields to this schema will build a form that can be used to create and edit new patients.

#### "Name" text input

Filament bundles a large selection of [form fields](../forms/fields/getting-started#available-fields). Let's start with a simple [text input field](../forms/fields/text-input):

```php
use Filament\Forms;
use Filament\Forms\Form;

public static function form(Form $form): Form
{
    return $form
        ->schema([
            Forms\Components\TextInput::make('name'),
        ]);
}
```

Visit `/admin/patients/create` (or click the "New Patient" button) and observe that a form field for the patient's name was added.

Since this field is required in the database and has a maximum length of 255 characters, let's add two [validation rules](../forms/validation) to the name field:

```php
use Filament\Forms;

Forms\Components\TextInput::make('name')
    ->required()
    ->maxLength(255)
```

Attempt to submit the form to create a new patient without a name and observe that a message is displayed informing you that the name field is required.

#### "Type" select

Let's add a second field for the type of patient: a choice between a cat, dog, or rabbit. Since there's a fixed set of options to choose from, a [select](../forms/fields/select) field works well:

```php
use Filament\Forms;
use Filament\Forms\Form;

public static function form(Form $form): Form
{
    return $form
        ->schema([
            Forms\Components\TextInput::make('name')
                ->required()
                ->maxLength(255),
            Forms\Components\Select::make('type')
                ->options([
                    'cat' => 'Cat',
                    'dog' => 'Dog',
                    'rabbit' => 'Rabbit',
                ]),
        ]);
}
```

The `options()` method of the Select field accepts an array of options for the user to choose from. The array keys should match the database, and the values are used as the form labels. Feel free to add as many animals to this array as you wish.

Since this field is also required in the database, let's add the `required()` validation rule:

```php
use Filament\Forms;

Forms\Components\Select::make('type')
    ->options([
        'cat' => 'Cat',
        'dog' => 'Dog',
        'rabbit' => 'Rabbit',
    ])
    ->required()
```

#### "Date of birth" picker

Let's add a [date picker field](../forms/fields/date-time-picker) for the `date_of_birth` column along with the validation (the date of birth is required and the date should be no later than the current day).

```php
use Filament\Forms;
use Filament\Forms\Form;

public static function form(Form $form): Form
{
    return $form
        ->schema([
            Forms\Components\TextInput::make('name')
                ->required()
                ->maxLength(255),
            Forms\Components\Select::make('type')
                ->options([
                    'cat' => 'Cat',
                    'dog' => 'Dog',
                    'rabbit' => 'Rabbit',
                ])
                ->required(),
            Forms\Components\DatePicker::make('date_of_birth')
                ->required()
                ->maxDate(now()),
        ]);
}
```

#### "Owner" select

We should also add an owner when creating a new patient. Since we added a `BelongsTo` relationship in the Patient model (associating it to the related `Owner` model), we can use the **[`relationship()` method](../forms/fields/select#integrating-with-an-eloquent-relationship)** from the select field to load a list of owners to choose from:

```php
use Filament\Forms;
use Filament\Forms\Form;

public static function form(Form $form): Form
{
    return $form
        ->schema([
            Forms\Components\TextInput::make('name')
                ->required()
                ->maxLength(255),
            Forms\Components\Select::make('type')
                ->options([
                    'cat' => 'Cat',
                    'dog' => 'Dog',
                    'rabbit' => 'Rabbit',
                ])
                ->required(),
            Forms\Components\DatePicker::make('date_of_birth')
                ->required()
                ->maxDate(now()),
            Forms\Components\Select::make('owner_id')
                ->relationship('owner', 'name')
                ->required(),
        ]);
}
```

The first argument of the `relationship()` method is the name of the function that defines the relationship in the model (used by Filament to load the select options) — in this case, `owner`. The second argument is the column name to use from the related table — in this case, `name`.

Let's also make the `owner` field required, `searchable()`, and `preload()` the first 50 owners into the searchable list (in case the list is long):

```php
use Filament\Forms;

Forms\Components\Select::make('owner_id')
    ->relationship('owner', 'name')
    ->searchable()
    ->preload()
    ->required()
```

#### Creating new owners without leaving the page
Currently, there are no owners in our database. Instead of creating a separate Filament owner resource, let's give users an easier way to add owners via a modal form (accessible as a `+` button next to the select). Use the [`createOptionForm()` method](../forms/fields/select#creating-a-new-option-in-a-modal) to embed a modal form with [`TextInput` fields](../forms/fields/text-input) for the owner's name, email address, and phone number:

```php
use Filament\Forms;

Forms\Components\Select::make('owner_id')
    ->relationship('owner', 'name')
    ->searchable()
    ->preload()
    ->createOptionForm([
        Forms\Components\TextInput::make('name')
            ->required()
            ->maxLength(255),
        Forms\Components\TextInput::make('email')
            ->label('Email address')
            ->email()
            ->required()
            ->maxLength(255),
        Forms\Components\TextInput::make('phone')
            ->label('Phone number')
            ->tel()
            ->required(),
    ])
    ->required()
```

A few new methods on the TextInput were used in this example:

- `label()` overrides the auto-generated label for each field. In this case, we want the `Email` label to be `Email address`, and the `Phone` label to be `Phone number`.
- `email()` ensures that only valid email addresses can be input into the field. It also changes the keyboard layout on mobile devices.
- `tel()` ensures that only valid phone numbers can be input into the field. It also changes the keyboard layout on mobile devices.

The form should be working now! Try creating a new patient and their owner. Once created, you will be redirected to the Edit page, where you can update their details.

### Setting up the patients table

Visit the `/admin/patients` page again. If you have created a patient, there should be one empty row in the table — with an edit button. Let's add some columns to the table, so we can view the actual patient data.

Open the `PatientResource.php` file. You should see a `table()` method with an empty `columns([...])` array. You can use this array to add columns to the `patients` table.

#### Adding text columns

Filament bundles a large selection of [table columns](../tables/columns#available-columns). Let's use a simple [text column](../tables/columns/text) for all the fields in the `patients` table:

```php
use Filament\Tables;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public static function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            Tables\Columns\TextColumn::make('name'),
            Tables\Columns\TextColumn::make('type'),
            Tables\Columns\TextColumn::make('date_of_birth'),
            Tables\Columns\TextColumn::make('owner.name'),
        ]);
}
```

> Filament uses dot notation to eager-load related data. We used `owner.name` in our table to display a list of owner names instead of less informational ID numbers. You could also add columns for the owner's email address and phone number.

##### Making columns searchable

The ability to [search](../tables/columns/getting-started#searching) for patients directly in the table would be helpful as a veterinary practice grows. You can make columns searchable by chaining the `searchable()` method to the column. Let's make the patient's name and owner's name searchable.

```php
use Filament\Tables;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public static function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            Tables\Columns\TextColumn::make('name')
                ->searchable(),
            Tables\Columns\TextColumn::make('type'),
            Tables\Columns\TextColumn::make('date_of_birth'),
            Tables\Columns\TextColumn::make('owner.name')
                ->searchable(),
        ]);
}
```

Reload the page and observe a new search input field on the table that filters the table entries using the search criteria.

##### Making the columns sortable

To make the `patients` table [sortable](../tables/columns/getting-started#sorting) by age, add the `sortable()` method to the `date_of_birth` column:

```php
use Filament\Tables;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public static function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            Tables\Columns\TextColumn::make('name')
                ->searchable(),
            Tables\Columns\TextColumn::make('type'),
            Tables\Columns\TextColumn::make('date_of_birth')
                ->sortable(),
            Tables\Columns\TextColumn::make('owner.name')
                ->searchable(),
        ]);
}
```

This will add a sort icon button to the column header. Clicking it will sort the table by date of birth.

#### Filtering the table by patient type

Although you can make the `type` field searchable, making it filterable is a much better user experience.

Filament tables can have [filters](../tables/filters/getting-started#available-filters), which are components that reduce the number of records in a table by adding a scope to the Eloquent query. Filters can even contain custom form components, making them a potent tool for building interfaces.

Filament includes a prebuilt [`SelectFilter`](../tables/filters/select) that you can add to the table's `filters()`:

```php
use Filament\Tables;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public static function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            // ...
        ])
        ->filters([
            Tables\Filters\SelectFilter::make('type')
                ->options([
                    'cat' => 'Cat',
                    'dog' => 'Dog',
                    'rabbit' => 'Rabbit',
                ]),
        ]);
}
```

Reload the page, and you should see a new filter icon in the top right corner (next to the search form). The filter opens a select menu with a list of patient types. Try filtering your patients by type.

## Introducing relation managers

Currently, patients can be associated with their owners in our system. But what happens if we want a third level? Patients come to the vet practice for treatment, and the system should be able to record these treatments and associate them with a patient.

One option is to create a new `TreatmentResource` with a select field to associate treatments with a patient. However, managing treatments separately from the rest of the patient information is cumbersome for the user. Filament uses "relation managers" to solve this problem.

Relation managers are tables that display related records for an existing resource on the edit screen for the parent resource. For example, in our project, you could view and manage a patient's treatments directly below their edit form.

> You can also use Filament ["actions"](../actions/modals#modal-forms) to open a modal form to create, edit, and delete treatments directly from the patient's table.

Use the `make:filament-relation-manager` artisan command to quickly create a relation manager, connecting the patient resource to the related treatments:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-relation-manager PatientResource treatments description
```

- `PatientResource` is the name of the resource class for the owner model. Since treatments belong to patients, the treatments should be displayed on the Edit Patient page.
- `treatments` is the name of the relationship in the Patient model we created earlier.
- `description` is the column to display from the treatments table.

This will create a `PatientResource/RelationManagers/TreatmentsRelationManager.php` file. You must register the new relation manager in the `getRelations()` method of the `PatientResource`:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\PatientResource\RelationManagers;

public static function getRelations(): array
{
    return [
        RelationManagers\TreatmentsRelationManager::class,
    ];
}
```

The `TreatmentsRelationManager.php` file contains a class that is prepopulated with a form and table using the parameters from the `make:filament-relation-manager` artisan command. You can customize the fields and columns in the relation manager similar to how you would in a resource:

```php
use Filament\Forms;
use Filament\Forms\Form;
use Filament\Tables;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function form(Form $form): Form
{
    return $form
        ->schema([
            Forms\Components\TextInput::make('description')
                ->required()
                ->maxLength(255),
        ]);
}

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            Tables\Columns\TextColumn::make('description'),
        ]);
}
```

Visit the Edit page for one of your patients. You should already be able to create, edit, delete, and list treatments for that patient.

### Setting up the treatment form

By default, text fields only span half the width of the form. Since the `description` field might contain a lot of information, add a `columnSpan('full')` method to make the field span the entire width of the modal form:

```php
use Filament\Forms;

Forms\Components\TextInput::make('description')
    ->required()
    ->maxLength(255)
    ->columnSpan('full')
```

Let's add the `notes` field, which can be used to add more details about the treatment. We can use a [textarea](../forms/fields/textarea) field with a `columnSpan('full')`:

```php
use Filament\Forms;
use Filament\Forms\Form;

public function form(Form $form): Form
{
    return $form
        ->schema([
            Forms\Components\TextInput::make('description')
                ->required()
                ->maxLength(255)
                ->columnSpan('full'),
            Forms\Components\Textarea::make('notes')
                ->maxLength(65535)
                ->columnSpan('full'),
        ]);
}
```

#### Configuring the `price` field

Let's add a `price` field for the treatment. We can use a text input with some customizations to make it suitable for currency input. It should be `numeric()`, which adds validation and changes the keyboard layout on mobile devices. Add your preferred currency prefix using the `prefix()` method; for example, `prefix('€')` will add a `€` before the input without impacting the saved output value:

```php
use Filament\Forms;
use Filament\Forms\Form;

public function form(Form $form): Form
{
    return $form
        ->schema([
            Forms\Components\TextInput::make('description')
                ->required()
                ->maxLength(255)
                ->columnSpan('full'),
            Forms\Components\Textarea::make('notes')
                ->maxLength(65535)
                ->columnSpan('full'),
            Forms\Components\TextInput::make('price')
                ->numeric()
                ->prefix('€')
                ->maxValue(42949672.95),
        ]);
}
```

##### Casting the price to an integer

Filament stores currency values as integers (not floats) to avoid rounding and precision issues — a widely-accepted approach in the Laravel community. However, this requires creating a cast in Laravel that transforms the integer into a float when retrieved and back to an integer when stored in the database. Use the following artisan command to create the cast:

```bash
php artisan make:cast MoneyCast
```

Inside the new `app/Casts/MoneyCast.php` file, update the `get()` and `set()` methods:

```php
public function get($model, string $key, $value, array $attributes): float
{
    // Transform the integer stored in the database into a float.
    return round(floatval($value) / 100, precision: 2);
}

public function set($model, string $key, $value, array $attributes): float
{
    // Transform the float into an integer for storage.
    return round(floatval($value) * 100);
}
```

Now, add the `MoneyCast` to the `price` attribute in the `Treatment` model:

```php
use App\Casts\MoneyCast;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Treatment extends Model
{
    protected $casts = [
        'price' => MoneyCast::class,
    ];

    // ...
}
```

### Setting up the treatments table

When the relation manager was generated previously, the `description` text column was automatically added. Let's also add a `sortable()` column for the `price` with a currency prefix. Use the Filament `money()` method to format the `price` column as money — in this case for `EUR` (`€`):

```php
use Filament\Tables;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            Tables\Columns\TextColumn::make('description'),
            Tables\Columns\TextColumn::make('price')
                ->money('EUR')
                ->sortable(),
        ]);
}
```

Let's also add a column to indicate when the treatment was administered using the default `created_at` timestamp. Use the `dateTime()` method to display the date-time in a human-readable format:

```php
use Filament\Tables;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            Tables\Columns\TextColumn::make('description'),
            Tables\Columns\TextColumn::make('price')
                ->money('EUR')
                ->sortable(),
            Tables\Columns\TextColumn::make('created_at')
                ->dateTime(),
        ]);
}
```

> You can pass any valid [PHP date formatting string](https://www.php.net/manual/en/datetime.format.php) to the `dateTime()` method (e.g. `dateTime('m-d-Y h:i A')`).

## Introducing widgets

Filament widgets are components that display information on your dashboard, especially statistics. Widgets are typically added to the default [Dashboard](../panels/dashboard) of the panel, but you can add them to any page, including resource pages. Filament includes built-in widgets like the [stats widget](../widgets/stats-overview), to render important statistics in a simple overview; [chart widget](../widgets/charts), which can render an interactive chart; and [table widget](../panels/dashboard#table-widgets), which allows you to easily embed the Table Builder.

Let's add a stats widget to our default dashboard page that includes a stat for each type of patient and a chart to visualize treatments administered over time.

### Creating a stats widget

Create a [stats widget](../widgets/stats-overview) to render patient types using the following artisan command:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-widget PatientTypeOverview --stats-overview
```

When prompted, do not specify a resource, and select "admin" for the location.

This will create a new `app/Filament/Widgets/PatientTypeOverview.php` file. Open it, and return `Stat` instances from the `getStats()` method:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Filament\Widgets;

use App\Models\Patient;
use Filament\Widgets\StatsOverviewWidget as BaseWidget;
use Filament\Widgets\StatsOverviewWidget\Stat;

class PatientTypeOverview extends BaseWidget
{
    protected function getStats(): array
    {
        return [
            Stat::make('Cats', Patient::query()->where('type', 'cat')->count()),
            Stat::make('Dogs', Patient::query()->where('type', 'dog')->count()),
            Stat::make('Rabbits', Patient::query()->where('type', 'rabbit')->count()),
        ];
    }
}
```

Open your dashboard, and you should see your new widget displayed. Each stat should show the total number of patients for the specified type.

### Creating a chart widget

Let's add a chart to the dashboard to visualize the number of treatments administered over time. Use the following artisan command to create a new chart widget:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-widget TreatmentsChart --chart
```

When prompted, do not specify a resource, select "admin" for the location, and choose "line chart" as the chart type.

Open `app/Filament/Widgets/TreatmentsChart.php` and set the `$heading` of the chart to "Treatments".

The `getData()` method returns an array of datasets and labels. Each dataset is a labeled array of points to plot on the chart, and each label is a string. This structure is identical to the [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/docs) library, which Filament uses to render charts.

To populate chart data from an Eloquent model, Filament recommends that you install the [flowframe/laravel-trend](https://github.com/Flowframe/laravel-trend) package:

```bash
composer require flowframe/laravel-trend
```

Update the `getData()` to display the number of treatments per month for the past year:

```php
use App\Models\Treatment;
use Flowframe\Trend\Trend;
use Flowframe\Trend\TrendValue;

protected function getData(): array
{
    $data = Trend::model(Treatment::class)
        ->between(
            start: now()->subYear(),
            end: now(),
        )
        ->perMonth()
        ->count();

    return [
        'datasets' => [
            [
                'label' => 'Treatments',
                'data' => $data->map(fn (TrendValue $value) => $value->aggregate),
            ],
        ],
        'labels' => $data->map(fn (TrendValue $value) => $value->date),
    ];
}
```

Now, check out your new chart widget in the dashboard!

> You can [customize your dashboard page](../panels/dashboard#customizing-the-dashboard-page) to change the grid and how many widgets are displayed.

## Overview

<LaracastsBanner
    title="Introduction to Filament"
    description="Watch the Rapid Laravel Development with Filament series on Laracasts - it will teach you how to get started with the resources."
    url="https://laracasts.com/series/rapid-laravel-development-with-filament/episodes/2"
    series="rapid-laravel-development"
/>

Resources are static classes that are used to build CRUD interfaces for your Eloquent models. They describe how administrators should be able to interact with data from your app - using tables and forms.

## Creating a resource

To create a resource for the `App\Models\Customer` model:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-resource Customer
```

This will create several files in the `app/Filament/Resources` directory:

```
.
+-- CustomerResource.php
+-- CustomerResource
|   +-- Pages
|   |   +-- CreateCustomer.php
|   |   +-- EditCustomer.php
|   |   +-- ListCustomers.php
```

Your new resource class lives in `CustomerResource.php`.

The classes in the `Pages` directory are used to customize the pages in the app that interact with your resource. They're all full-page [Livewire](https://livewire.laravel.com) components that you can customize in any way you wish.

> Have you created a resource, but it's not appearing in the navigation menu? If you have a [model policy](#authorization), make sure you return `true` from the `viewAny()` method.

### Simple (modal) resources

Sometimes, your models are simple enough that you only want to manage records on one page, using modals to create, edit and delete records. To generate a simple resource with modals:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-resource Customer --simple
```

Your resource will have a "Manage" page, which is a List page with modals added.

Additionally, your simple resource will have no `getRelations()` method, as [relation managers](relation-managers) are only displayed on the Edit and View pages, which are not present in simple resources. Everything else is the same.

### Automatically generating forms and tables

If you'd like to save time, Filament can automatically generate the [form](#resource-forms) and [table](#resource-tables) for you, based on your model's database columns, using `--generate`:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-resource Customer --generate
```

### Handling soft deletes

By default, you will not be able to interact with deleted records in the app. If you'd like to add functionality to restore, force delete and filter trashed records in your resource, use the `--soft-deletes` flag when generating the resource:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-resource Customer --soft-deletes
```

You can find out more about soft deleting [here](deleting-records#handling-soft-deletes).

### Generating a View page

By default, only List, Create and Edit pages are generated for your resource. If you'd also like a [View page](viewing-records), use the `--view` flag:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-resource Customer --view
```

### Specifiying a custom model namespace

By default, Filament will assume that your model exists in the `App\Models` directory. You can pass a different namespace for the model using the `--model-namespace` flag:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-resource Customer --model-namespace=Custom\\Path\\Models
```

In this example, the model should exist at `Custom\Path\Models\Customer`. Please note the double backslashes `\\` in the command that are required.

Now when [generating the resource](#automatically-generating-forms-and-tables), Filament will be able to locate the model and read the database schema.

### Generating the model, migration and factory at the same name

If you'd like to save time when scaffolding your resources, Filament can also generate the model, migration and factory for the new resource at the same time using the `--model`, `--migration` and `--factory` flags in any combination:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-resource Customer --model --migration --factory
```

## Record titles

A `$recordTitleAttribute` may be set for your resource, which is the name of the column on your model that can be used to identify it from others.

For example, this could be a blog post's `title` or a customer's `name`:

```php
protected static ?string $recordTitleAttribute = 'name';
```

This is required for features like [global search](global-search) to work.

> You may specify the name of an [Eloquent accessor](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-mutators#defining-an-accessor) if just one column is inadequate at identifying a record.

## Resource forms

<LaracastsBanner
    title="Basic Form Inputs"
    description="Watch the Rapid Laravel Development with Filament series on Laracasts - it will teach you the basics of adding a form to your resource."
    url="https://laracasts.com/series/rapid-laravel-development-with-filament/episodes/3"
    series="rapid-laravel-development"
/>

Resource classes contain a `form()` method that is used to build the forms on the [Create](creating-records) and [Edit](editing-records) pages:

```php
use Filament\Forms;
use Filament\Forms\Form;

public static function form(Form $form): Form
{
    return $form
        ->schema([
            Forms\Components\TextInput::make('name')->required(),
            Forms\Components\TextInput::make('email')->email()->required(),
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

The `schema()` method is used to define the structure of your form. It is an array of [fields](../../forms/fields/getting-started#available-fields) and [layout components](../../forms/layout/getting-started#available-layout-components), in the order they should appear in your form.

Check out the Forms docs for a [guide](../../forms/getting-started) on how to build forms with Filament.

### Hiding components based on the current operation

The `hiddenOn()` method of form components allows you to dynamically hide fields based on the current page or action.

In this example, we hide the `password` field on the `edit` page:

```php
use Livewire\Component;

Forms\Components\TextInput::make('password')
    ->password()
    ->required()
    ->hiddenOn('edit'),
```

Alternatively, we have a `visibleOn()` shortcut method for only showing a field on one page or action:

```php
use Livewire\Component;

Forms\Components\TextInput::make('password')
    ->password()
    ->required()
    ->visibleOn('create'),
```

## Resource tables

<LaracastsBanner
    title="Table Columns"
    description="Watch the Rapid Laravel Development with Filament series on Laracasts - it will teach you the basics of adding a table to your resource."
    url="https://laracasts.com/series/rapid-laravel-development-with-filament/episodes/9"
    series="rapid-laravel-development"
/>

Resource classes contain a `table()` method that is used to build the table on the [List page](listing-records):

```php
use Filament\Tables;
use Filament\Tables\Table;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

public static function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            Tables\Columns\TextColumn::make('name'),
            Tables\Columns\TextColumn::make('email'),
            // ...
        ])
        ->filters([
            Tables\Filters\Filter::make('verified')
                ->query(fn (Builder $query): Builder => $query->whereNotNull('email_verified_at')),
            // ...
        ])
        ->actions([
            Tables\Actions\EditAction::make(),
        ])
        ->bulkActions([
            Tables\Actions\BulkActionGroup::make([
                Tables\Actions\DeleteBulkAction::make(),
            ]),
        ]);
}
```

Check out the [tables](../../tables/getting-started) docs to find out how to add table columns, filters, actions and more.

## Authorization

For authorization, Filament will observe any [model policies](https://laravel.com/docs/authorization#creating-policies) that are registered in your app. The following methods are used:

- `viewAny()` is used to completely hide resources from the navigation menu, and prevents the user from accessing any pages.
- `create()` is used to control [creating new records](creating-records).
- `update()` is used to control [editing a record](editing-records).
- `view()` is used to control [viewing a record](viewing-records).
- `delete()` is used to prevent a single record from being deleted. `deleteAny()` is used to prevent records from being bulk deleted. Filament uses the `deleteAny()` method because iterating through multiple records and checking the `delete()` policy is not very performant.
- `forceDelete()` is used to prevent a single soft-deleted record from being force-deleted. `forceDeleteAny()` is used to prevent records from being bulk force-deleted. Filament uses the `forceDeleteAny()` method because iterating through multiple records and checking the `forceDelete()` policy is not very performant.
- `restore()` is used to prevent a single soft-deleted record from being restored. `restoreAny()` is used to prevent records from being bulk restored. Filament uses the `restoreAny()` method because iterating through multiple records and checking the `restore()` policy is not very performant.
- `reorder()` is used to control [reordering a record](listing-records#reordering-records).

### Skipping authorization

If you'd like to skip authorization for a resource, you may set the `$shouldSkipAuthorization` property to `true`:

```php
protected static bool $shouldSkipAuthorization = true;
```

## Customizing the model label

Each resource has a "model label" which is automatically generated from the model name. For example, an `App\Models\Customer` model will have a `customer` label.

The label is used in several parts of the UI, and you may customize it using the `$modelLabel` property:

```php
protected static ?string $modelLabel = 'cliente';
```

Alternatively, you may use the `getModelLabel()` to define a dynamic label:

```php
public static function getModelLabel(): string
{
    return __('filament/resources/customer.label');
}
```

### Customizing the plural model label

Resources also have a "plural model label" which is automatically generated from the model label. For example, a `customer` label will be pluralized into `customers`.

You may customize the plural version of the label using the `$pluralModelLabel` property:

```php
protected static ?string $pluralModelLabel = 'clientes';
```

Alternatively, you may set a dynamic plural label in the `getPluralModelLabel()` method:

```php
public static function getPluralModelLabel(): string
{
    return __('filament/resources/customer.plural_label');
}
```

### Automatic model label capitalization

By default, Filament will automatically capitalize each word in the model label, for some parts of the UI. For example, in page titles, the navigation menu, and the breadcrumbs.

If you want to disable this behavior for a resource, you can set `$hasTitleCaseModelLabel` in the resource:

```php
protected static bool $hasTitleCaseModelLabel = false;
```

## Resource navigation items

Filament will automatically generate a navigation menu item for your resource using the [plural label](#plural-label).

If you'd like to customize the navigation item label, you may use the `$navigationLabel` property:

```php
protected static ?string $navigationLabel = 'Mis Clientes';
```

Alternatively, you may set a dynamic navigation label in the `getNavigationLabel()` method:

```php
public static function getNavigationLabel(): string
{
    return __('filament/resources/customer.navigation_label');
}
```

### Setting a resource navigation icon

The `$navigationIcon` property supports the name of any Blade component. By default, [Heroicons](https://heroicons.com) are installed. However, you may create your own custom icon components or install an alternative library if you wish.

```php
protected static ?string $navigationIcon = 'heroicon-o-user-group';
```

Alternatively, you may set a dynamic navigation icon in the `getNavigationIcon()` method:

```php
use Illuminate\Contracts\Support\Htmlable;

public static function getNavigationIcon(): string | Htmlable | null
{
    return 'heroicon-o-user-group';
}
```

### Sorting resource navigation items

The `$navigationSort` property allows you to specify the order in which navigation items are listed:

```php
protected static ?int $navigationSort = 2;
```

Alternatively, you may set a dynamic navigation item order in the `getNavigationSort()` method:

```php
public static function getNavigationSort(): ?int
{
    return 2;
}
```

### Grouping resource navigation items

You may group navigation items by specifying a `$navigationGroup` property:

```php
protected static ?string $navigationGroup = 'Shop';
```

Alternatively, you may use the `getNavigationGroup()` method to set a dynamic group label:

```php
public static function getNavigationGroup(): ?string
{
    return __('filament/navigation.groups.shop');
}
```

#### Grouping resource navigation items under other items

You may group navigation items as children of other items, by passing the label of the parent item as the `$navigationParentItem`:

```php
protected static ?string $navigationParentItem = 'Products';

protected static ?string $navigationGroup = 'Shop';
```

As seen above, if the parent item has a navigation group, that navigation group must also be defined, so the correct parent item can be identified.

You may also use the `getNavigationParentItem()` method to set a dynamic parent item label:

```php
public static function getNavigationParentItem(): ?string
{
    return __('filament/navigation.groups.shop.items.products');
}
```

> If you're reaching for a third level of navigation like this, you should consider using [clusters](clusters) instead, which are a logical grouping of resources and [custom pages](../pages), which can share their own separate navigation.

## Generating URLs to resource pages

Filament provides `getUrl()` static method on resource classes to generate URLs to resources and specific pages within them. Traditionally, you would need to construct the URL by hand or by using Laravel's `route()` helper, but these methods depend on knowledge of the resource's slug or route naming conventions.

The `getUrl()` method, without any arguments, will generate a URL to the resource's [List page](listing-records):

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\CustomerResource;

CustomerResource::getUrl(); // /admin/customers
```

You may also generate URLs to specific pages within the resource. The name of each page is the array key in the `getPages()` array of the resource. For example, to generate a URL to the [Create page](creating-records):

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\CustomerResource;

CustomerResource::getUrl('create'); // /admin/customers/create
```

Some pages in the `getPages()` method use URL parameters like `record`. To generate a URL to these pages and pass in a record, you should use the second argument:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\CustomerResource;

CustomerResource::getUrl('edit', ['record' => $customer]); // /admin/customers/edit/1
```

In this example, `$customer` can be an Eloquent model object, or an ID.

### Generating URLs to resource modals

This can be especially useful if you are using [simple resources](#simple-modal-resources) with only one page.

To generate a URL for an action in the resource's table, you should pass the `tableAction` and `tableActionRecord` as URL parameters:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\CustomerResource;
use Filament\Tables\Actions\EditAction;

CustomerResource::getUrl(parameters: [
    'tableAction' => EditAction::getDefaultName(),
    'tableActionRecord' => $customer,
]); // /admin/customers?tableAction=edit&tableActionRecord=1
```

Or if you want to generate a URL for an action on the page like a `CreateAction` in the header, you can pass it in to the `action` parameter:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\CustomerResource;
use Filament\Actions\CreateAction;

CustomerResource::getUrl(parameters: [
    'action' => CreateAction::getDefaultName(),
]); // /admin/customers?action=create
```

### Generating URLs to resources in other panels

If you have multiple panels in your app, `getUrl()` will generate a URL within the current panel. You can also indicate which panel the resource is associated with, by passing the panel ID to the `panel` argument:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\CustomerResource;

CustomerResource::getUrl(panel: 'marketing');
```

## Customizing the resource Eloquent query

Within Filament, every query to your resource model will start with the `getEloquentQuery()` method.

Because of this, it's very easy to apply your own query constraints or [model scopes](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent#query-scopes) that affect the entire resource:

```php
public static function getEloquentQuery(): Builder
{
    return parent::getEloquentQuery()->where('is_active', true);
}
```

### Disabling global scopes

By default, Filament will observe all global scopes that are registered to your model. However, this may not be ideal if you wish to access, for example, soft deleted records.

To overcome this, you may override the `getEloquentQuery()` method that Filament uses:

```php
public static function getEloquentQuery(): Builder
{
    return parent::getEloquentQuery()->withoutGlobalScopes();
}
```

Alternatively, you may remove specific global scopes:

```php
public static function getEloquentQuery(): Builder
{
    return parent::getEloquentQuery()->withoutGlobalScopes([ActiveScope::class]);
}
```

More information about removing global scopes may be found in the [Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent#removing-global-scopes).

## Customizing the resource URL

By default, Filament will generate a URL based on the name of the resource. You can customize this by setting the `$slug` property on the resource:

```php
protected static ?string $slug = 'pending-orders';
```

## Resource sub-navigation

Sub-navigation allows the user to navigate between different pages within a resource. Typically, all pages in the sub-navigation will be related to the same record in the resource. For example, in a Customer resource, you may have a sub-navigation with the following pages:

- View customer, a [`ViewRecord` page](viewing-records) that provides a read-only view of the customer's details.
- Edit customer, an [`EditRecord` page](editing-records) that allows the user to edit the customer's details.
- Edit customer contact, an [`EditRecord` page](editing-records) that allows the user to edit the customer's contact details. You can [learn how to create more than one Edit page](editing-records#creating-another-edit-page).
- Manage addresses, a [`ManageRelatedRecords` page](relation-managers#relation-pages) that allows the user to manage the customer's addresses.
- Manage payments, a [`ManageRelatedRecords` page](relation-managers#relation-pages) that allows the user to manage the customer's payments.

To add a sub-navigation to each "singular record" page in the resource, you can add the `getRecordSubNavigation()` method to the resource class:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\CustomerResource\Pages;
use Filament\Resources\Pages\Page;

public static function getRecordSubNavigation(Page $page): array
{
    return $page->generateNavigationItems([
        Pages\ViewCustomer::class,
        Pages\EditCustomer::class,
        Pages\EditCustomerContact::class,
        Pages\ManageCustomerAddresses::class,
        Pages\ManageCustomerPayments::class,
    ]);
}
```

Each item in the sub-navigation can be customized using the [same navigation methods as normal pages](../navigation).

> If you're looking to add sub-navigation to switch *between* entire resources and [custom pages](../pages), you might be looking for [clusters](../clusters), which are used to group these together. The `getRecordSubNavigation()` method is intended to construct a navigation between pages that relate to a particular record *inside* a resource.

### Sub-navigation position

The sub-navigation is rendered at the start of the page by default. You may change the position by setting the `$subNavigationPosition` property on the resource. The value may be `SubNavigationPosition::Start`, `SubNavigationPosition::End`, or `SubNavigationPosition::Top` to render the sub-navigation as tabs:

```php
use Filament\Pages\SubNavigationPosition;

protected static SubNavigationPosition $subNavigationPosition = SubNavigationPosition::End;
```

## Deleting resource pages

If you'd like to delete a page from your resource, you can just delete the page file from the `Pages` directory of your resource, and its entry in the `getPages()` method.

For example, you may have a resource with records that may not be created by anyone. Delete the `Create` page file, and then remove it from `getPages()`:

```php
public static function getPages(): array
{
    return [
        'index' => Pages\ListCustomers::route('/'),
        'edit' => Pages\EditCustomer::route('/{record}/edit'),
    ];
}
```

Deleting a page will not delete any actions that link to that page. Any actions will open a modal instead of sending the user to the non-existent page. For instance, the `CreateAction` on the List page, the `EditAction` on the table or View page, or the `ViewAction` on the table or Edit page. If you want to remove those buttons, you must delete the actions as well.

title: Listing records

## Using tabs to filter the records

You can add tabs above the table, which can be used to filter the records based on some predefined conditions. Each tab can scope the Eloquent query of the table in a different way. To register tabs, add a `getTabs()` method to the List page class, and return an array of `Tab` objects:

```php
use Filament\Resources\Components\Tab;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

public function getTabs(): array
{
    return [
        'all' => Tab::make(),
        'active' => Tab::make()
            ->modifyQueryUsing(fn (Builder $query) => $query->where('active', true)),
        'inactive' => Tab::make()
            ->modifyQueryUsing(fn (Builder $query) => $query->where('active', false)),
    ];
}
```

### Customizing the filter tab labels

The keys of the array will be used as identifiers for the tabs, so they can be persisted in the URL's query string. The label of each tab is also generated from the key, but you can override that by passing a label into the `make()` method of the tab:

```php
use Filament\Resources\Components\Tab;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

public function getTabs(): array
{
    return [
        'all' => Tab::make('All customers'),
        'active' => Tab::make('Active customers')
            ->modifyQueryUsing(fn (Builder $query) => $query->where('active', true)),
        'inactive' => Tab::make('Inactive customers')
            ->modifyQueryUsing(fn (Builder $query) => $query->where('active', false)),
    ];
}
```

### Adding icons to filter tabs

You can add icons to the tabs by passing an [icon](https://blade-ui-kit.com/blade-icons?set=1#search) into the `icon()` method of the tab:

```php
use use Filament\Resources\Components\Tab;

Tab::make()
    ->icon('heroicon-m-user-group')
```

You can also change the icon's position to be after the label instead of before it, using the `iconPosition()` method:

```php
use Filament\Support\Enums\IconPosition;

Tab::make()
    ->icon('heroicon-m-user-group')
    ->iconPosition(IconPosition::After)
```

### Adding badges to filter tabs

You can add badges to the tabs by passing a string into the `badge()` method of the tab:

```php
use Filament\Resources\Components\Tab;

Tab::make()
    ->badge(Customer::query()->where('active', true)->count())
```

#### Changing the color of filter tab badges

The color of a badge may be changed using the `badgeColor()` method:

```php
use Filament\Resources\Components\Tab;

Tab::make()
    ->badge(Customer::query()->where('active', true)->count())
    ->badgeColor('success')
```

### Adding extra attributes to filter tabs

You may also pass extra HTML attributes to filter tabs using `extraAttributes()`:

```php
use Filament\Resources\Components\Tab;

Tab::make()
    ->extraAttributes(['data-cy' => 'statement-confirmed-tab'])
```

### Customizing the default tab

To customize the default tab that is selected when the page is loaded, you can return the array key of the tab from the `getDefaultActiveTab()` method:

```php
use Filament\Resources\Components\Tab;

public function getTabs(): array
{
    return [
        'all' => Tab::make(),
        'active' => Tab::make(),
        'inactive' => Tab::make(),
    ];
}

public function getDefaultActiveTab(): string | int | null
{
    return 'active';
}
```

## Authorization

For authorization, Filament will observe any [model policies](https://laravel.com/docs/authorization#creating-policies) that are registered in your app.

Users may access the List page if the `viewAny()` method of the model policy returns `true`.

The `reorder()` method is used to control [reordering a record](#reordering-records).

## Customizing the table Eloquent query

Although you can [customize the Eloquent query for the entire resource](getting-started#customizing-the-resource-eloquent-query), you may also make specific modifications for the List page table. To do this, use the `modifyQueryUsing()` method in the `table()` method of the resource:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

public static function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->modifyQueryUsing(fn (Builder $query) => $query->withoutGlobalScopes());
}
```

## Custom list page view

For further customization opportunities, you can override the static `$view` property on the page class to a custom view in your app:

```php
protected static string $view = 'filament.resources.users.pages.list-users';
```

This assumes that you have created a view at `resources/views/filament/resources/users/pages/list-users.blade.php`.

Here's a basic example of what that view might contain:

```blade
<x-filament-panels::page>
    {{ $this->table }}
</x-filament-panels::page>
```

To see everything that the default view contains, you can check the `vendor/filament/filament/resources/views/resources/pages/list-records.blade.php` file in your project.

# Documentation for panels. File: 03-resources/03-creating-records.md
---
title: Creating records
---

## Customizing data before saving

Sometimes, you may wish to modify form data before it is finally saved to the database. To do this, you may define a `mutateFormDataBeforeCreate()` method on the Create page class, which accepts the `$data` as an array, and returns the modified version:

```php
protected function mutateFormDataBeforeCreate(array $data): array
{
    $data['user_id'] = auth()->id();

    return $data;
}
```

Alternatively, if you're creating records in a modal action, check out the [Actions documentation](../../actions/prebuilt-actions/create#customizing-data-before-saving).

## Customizing the creation process

You can tweak how the record is created using the `handleRecordCreation()` method on the Create page class:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

protected function handleRecordCreation(array $data): Model
{
    return static::getModel()::create($data);
}
```

Alternatively, if you're creating records in a modal action, check out the [Actions documentation](../../actions/prebuilt-actions/create#customizing-the-creation-process).

## Customizing redirects

By default, after saving the form, the user will be redirected to the [Edit page](editing-records) of the resource, or the [View page](viewing-records) if it is present.

You may set up a custom redirect when the form is saved by overriding the `getRedirectUrl()` method on the Create page class.

For example, the form can redirect back to the [List page](listing-records):

```php
protected function getRedirectUrl(): string
{
    return $this->getResource()::getUrl('index');
}
```

If you wish to be redirected to the previous page, else the index page:

```php
protected function getRedirectUrl(): string
{
    return $this->previousUrl ?? $this->getResource()::getUrl('index');
}
```

## Customizing the save notification

When the record is successfully created, a notification is dispatched to the user, which indicates the success of their action.

To customize the title of this notification, define a `getCreatedNotificationTitle()` method on the create page class:

```php
protected function getCreatedNotificationTitle(): ?string
{
    return 'User registered';
}
```

Alternatively, if you're creating records in a modal action, check out the [Actions documentation](../../actions/prebuilt-actions/create#customizing-the-save-notification).

You may customize the entire notification by overriding the `getCreatedNotification()` method on the create page class:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

protected function getCreatedNotification(): ?Notification
{
    return Notification::make()
        ->success()
        ->title('User registered')
        ->body('The user has been created successfully.');
}
```

To disable the notification altogether, return `null` from the `getCreatedNotification()` method on the create page class:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

protected function getCreatedNotification(): ?Notification
{
    return null;
}
```

## Lifecycle hooks

Hooks may be used to execute code at various points within a page's lifecycle, like before a form is saved. To set up a hook, create a protected method on the Create page class with the name of the hook:

```php
protected function beforeCreate(): void
{
    // ...
}
```

In this example, the code in the `beforeCreate()` method will be called before the data in the form is saved to the database.

There are several available hooks for the Create page:

```php
use Filament\Resources\Pages\CreateRecord;

class CreateUser extends CreateRecord
{
    // ...

    protected function beforeFill(): void
    {
        // Runs before the form fields are populated with their default values.
    }

    protected function afterFill(): void
    {
        // Runs after the form fields are populated with their default values.
    }

    protected function beforeValidate(): void
    {
        // Runs before the form fields are validated when the form is submitted.
    }

    protected function afterValidate(): void
    {
        // Runs after the form fields are validated when the form is submitted.
    }

    protected function beforeCreate(): void
    {
        // Runs before the form fields are saved to the database.
    }

    protected function afterCreate(): void
    {
        // Runs after the form fields are saved to the database.
    }
}
```

Alternatively, if you're creating records in a modal action, check out the [Actions documentation](../../actions/prebuilt-actions/create#lifecycle-hooks).

## Halting the creation process

At any time, you may call `$this->halt()` from inside a lifecycle hook or mutation method, which will halt the entire creation process:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

protected function beforeCreate(): void
{
    if (! auth()->user()->team->subscribed()) {
        Notification::make()
            ->warning()
            ->title('You don\'t have an active subscription!')
            ->body('Choose a plan to continue.')
            ->persistent()
            ->actions([
                Action::make('subscribe')
                    ->button()
                    ->url(route('subscribe'), shouldOpenInNewTab: true),
            ])
            ->send();
    
        $this->halt();
    }
}
```

Alternatively, if you're creating records in a modal action, check out the [Actions documentation](../../actions/prebuilt-actions/create#halting-the-creation-process).

## Authorization

For authorization, Filament will observe any [model policies](https://laravel.com/docs/authorization#creating-policies) that are registered in your app.

Users may access the Create page if the `create()` method of the model policy returns `true`.

## Using a wizard

You may easily transform the creation process into a multistep wizard.

On the page class, add the corresponding `HasWizard` trait:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\CategoryResource;
use Filament\Resources\Pages\CreateRecord;

class CreateCategory extends CreateRecord
{
    use CreateRecord\Concerns\HasWizard;
    
    protected static string $resource = CategoryResource::class;

    protected function getSteps(): array
    {
        return [
            // ...
        ];
    }
}
```

Inside the `getSteps()` array, return your [wizard steps](../../forms/layout/wizard):

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\MarkdownEditor;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Toggle;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Wizard\Step;

protected function getSteps(): array
{
    return [
        Step::make('Name')
            ->description('Give the category a clear and unique name')
            ->schema([
                TextInput::make('name')
                    ->required()
                    ->live()
                    ->afterStateUpdated(fn ($state, callable $set) => $set('slug', Str::slug($state))),
                TextInput::make('slug')
                    ->disabled()
                    ->required()
                    ->unique(Category::class, 'slug', fn ($record) => $record),
            ]),
        Step::make('Description')
            ->description('Add some extra details')
            ->schema([
                MarkdownEditor::make('description')
                    ->columnSpan('full'),
            ]),
        Step::make('Visibility')
            ->description('Control who can view it')
            ->schema([
                Toggle::make('is_visible')
                    ->label('Visible to customers.')
                    ->default(true),
            ]),
    ];
}
```

Alternatively, if you're creating records in a modal action, check out the [Actions documentation](../../actions/prebuilt-actions/create#using-a-wizard).

Now, create a new record to see your wizard in action! Edit will still use the form defined within the resource class.

If you'd like to allow free navigation, so all the steps are skippable, override the `hasSkippableSteps()` method:

```php
public function hasSkippableSteps(): bool
{
    return true;
}
```

### Sharing fields between the resource form and wizards

If you'd like to reduce the amount of repetition between the resource form and wizard steps, it's a good idea to extract public static resource functions for your fields, where you can easily retrieve an instance of a field from the resource or the wizard:

```php
use Filament\Forms;
use Filament\Forms\Form;
use Filament\Resources\Resource;

class CategoryResource extends Resource
{
    public static function form(Form $form): Form
    {
        return $form
            ->schema([
                static::getNameFormField(),
                static::getSlugFormField(),
                // ...
            ]);
    }
    
    public static function getNameFormField(): Forms\Components\TextInput
    {
        return TextInput::make('name')
            ->required()
            ->live()
            ->afterStateUpdated(fn ($state, callable $set) => $set('slug', Str::slug($state)));
    }
    
    public static function getSlugFormField(): Forms\Components\TextInput
    {
        return TextInput::make('slug')
            ->disabled()
            ->required()
            ->unique(Category::class, 'slug', fn ($record) => $record);
    }
}
```

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\CategoryResource;
use Filament\Resources\Pages\CreateRecord;

class CreateCategory extends CreateRecord
{
    use CreateRecord\Concerns\HasWizard;
    
    protected static string $resource = CategoryResource::class;

    protected function getSteps(): array
    {
        return [
            Step::make('Name')
                ->description('Give the category a clear and unique name')
                ->schema([
                    CategoryResource::getNameFormField(),
                    CategoryResource::getSlugFormField(),
                ]),
            // ...
        ];
    }
}
```

## Importing resource records

Filament includes an `ImportAction` that you can add to the `getHeaderActions()` of the [List page](listing-records). It allows users to upload a CSV of data to import into the resource:

```php
use App\Filament\Imports\ProductImporter;
use Filament\Actions;

protected function getHeaderActions(): array
{
    return [
        Actions\ImportAction::make()
            ->importer(ProductImporter::class),
        Actions\CreateAction::make(),
    ];
}
```

The "importer" class [needs to be created](../../actions/prebuilt-actions/import#creating-an-importer) to tell Filament how to import each row of the CSV. You can learn everything about the `ImportAction` in the [Actions documentation](../../actions/prebuilt-actions/import).

## Custom actions

"Actions" are buttons that are displayed on pages, which allow the user to run a Livewire method on the page or visit a URL.

On resource pages, actions are usually in 2 places: in the top right of the page, and below the form.

For example, you may add a new button action in the header of the Create page:

```php
use App\Filament\Imports\UserImporter;
use Filament\Actions;
use Filament\Resources\Pages\CreateRecord;

class CreateUser extends CreateRecord
{
    // ...

    protected function getHeaderActions(): array
    {
        return [
            Actions\ImportAction::make()
                ->importer(UserImporter::class),
        ];
    }
}
```

Or, a new button next to "Create" below the form:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Resources\Pages\CreateRecord;

class CreateUser extends CreateRecord
{
    // ...

    protected function getFormActions(): array
    {
        return [
            ...parent::getFormActions(),
            Action::make('close')->action('createAndClose'),
        ];
    }

    public function createAndClose(): void
    {
        // ...
    }
}
```

To view the entire actions API, please visit the [pages section](../pages#adding-actions-to-pages).

### Adding a create action button to the header

The "Create" button can be moved to the header of the page by overriding the `getHeaderActions()` method and using `getCreateFormAction()`. You need to pass `formId()` to the action, to specify that the action should submit the form with the ID of `form`, which is the `<form>` ID used in the view of the page:

```php
protected function getHeaderActions(): array
{
    return [
        $this->getCreateFormAction()
            ->formId('form'),
    ];
}
```

You may remove all actions from the form by overriding the `getFormActions()` method to return an empty array:

```php
protected function getFormActions(): array
{
    return [];
}
```

## Custom view

For further customization opportunities, you can override the static `$view` property on the page class to a custom view in your app:

```php
protected static string $view = 'filament.resources.users.pages.create-user';
```

This assumes that you have created a view at `resources/views/filament/resources/users/pages/create-user.blade.php`.

Here's a basic example of what that view might contain:

```blade
<x-filament-panels::page>
    <x-filament-panels::form wire:submit="create">
        {{ $this->form }}

        <x-filament-panels::form.actions
            :actions="$this->getCachedFormActions()"
            :full-width="$this->hasFullWidthFormActions()"
        />
    </x-filament-panels::form>
</x-filament-panels::page>
```

To see everything that the default view contains, you can check the `vendor/filament/filament/resources/views/resources/pages/create-record.blade.php` file in your project.

# Documentation for panels. File: 03-resources/04-editing-records.md
---
title: Editing records
---

## Customizing data before filling the form

You may wish to modify the data from a record before it is filled into the form. To do this, you may define a `mutateFormDataBeforeFill()` method on the Edit page class to modify the `$data` array, and return the modified version before it is filled into the form:

```php
protected function mutateFormDataBeforeFill(array $data): array
{
    $data['user_id'] = auth()->id();

    return $data;
}
```

Alternatively, if you're editing records in a modal action, check out the [Actions documentation](../../actions/prebuilt-actions/edit#customizing-data-before-filling-the-form).

## Customizing data before saving

Sometimes, you may wish to modify form data before it is finally saved to the database. To do this, you may define a `mutateFormDataBeforeSave()` method on the Edit page class, which accepts the `$data` as an array, and returns it modified:

```php
protected function mutateFormDataBeforeSave(array $data): array
{
    $data['last_edited_by_id'] = auth()->id();

    return $data;
}
```

Alternatively, if you're editing records in a modal action, check out the [Actions documentation](../../actions/prebuilt-actions/edit#customizing-data-before-saving).

## Customizing the saving process

You can tweak how the record is updated using the `handleRecordUpdate()` method on the Edit page class:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

protected function handleRecordUpdate(Model $record, array $data): Model
{
    $record->update($data);

    return $record;
}
```

Alternatively, if you're editing records in a modal action, check out the [Actions documentation](../../actions/prebuilt-actions/edit#customizing-the-saving-process).

## Customizing redirects

By default, saving the form will not redirect the user to another page.

You may set up a custom redirect when the form is saved by overriding the `getRedirectUrl()` method on the Edit page class.

For example, the form can redirect back to the [List page](listing-records) of the resource:

```php
protected function getRedirectUrl(): string
{
    return $this->getResource()::getUrl('index');
}
```

Or the [View page](viewing-records):

```php
protected function getRedirectUrl(): string
{
    return $this->getResource()::getUrl('view', ['record' => $this->getRecord()]);
}
```

If you wish to be redirected to the previous page, else the index page:

```php
protected function getRedirectUrl(): string
{
    return $this->previousUrl ?? $this->getResource()::getUrl('index');
}
```

## Customizing the save notification

When the record is successfully updated, a notification is dispatched to the user, which indicates the success of their action.

To customize the title of this notification, define a `getSavedNotificationTitle()` method on the edit page class:

```php
protected function getSavedNotificationTitle(): ?string
{
    return 'User updated';
}
```

Alternatively, if you're editing records in a modal action, check out the [Actions documentation](../../actions/prebuilt-actions/edit#customizing-the-save-notification).

You may customize the entire notification by overriding the `getSavedNotification()` method on the edit page class:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

protected function getSavedNotification(): ?Notification
{
    return Notification::make()
        ->success()
        ->title('User updated')
        ->body('The user has been saved successfully.');
}
```

To disable the notification altogether, return `null` from the `getSavedNotification()` method on the edit page class:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

protected function getSavedNotification(): ?Notification
{
    return null;
}
```

## Lifecycle hooks

Hooks may be used to execute code at various points within a page's lifecycle, like before a form is saved. To set up a hook, create a protected method on the Edit page class with the name of the hook:

```php
protected function beforeSave(): void
{
    // ...
}
```

In this example, the code in the `beforeSave()` method will be called before the data in the form is saved to the database.

There are several available hooks for the Edit pages:

```php
use Filament\Resources\Pages\EditRecord;

class EditUser extends EditRecord
{
    // ...

    protected function beforeFill(): void
    {
        // Runs before the form fields are populated from the database.
    }

    protected function afterFill(): void
    {
        // Runs after the form fields are populated from the database.
    }

    protected function beforeValidate(): void
    {
        // Runs before the form fields are validated when the form is saved.
    }

    protected function afterValidate(): void
    {
        // Runs after the form fields are validated when the form is saved.
    }

    protected function beforeSave(): void
    {
        // Runs before the form fields are saved to the database.
    }

    protected function afterSave(): void
    {
        // Runs after the form fields are saved to the database.
    }
}
```

Alternatively, if you're editing records in a modal action, check out the [Actions documentation](../../actions/prebuilt-actions/edit#lifecycle-hooks).

## Saving a part of the form independently

You may want to allow the user to save a part of the form independently of the rest of the form. One way to do this is with a [section action in the header or footer](../../forms/layout/section#adding-actions-to-the-sections-header-or-footer). From the `action()` method, you can call `saveFormComponentOnly()`, passing in the `Section` component that you want to save:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Section;
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;
use Filament\Resources\Pages\EditRecord;

Section::make('Rate limiting')
    ->schema([
        // ...
    ])
    ->footerActions([
        fn (string $operation): Action => Action::make('save')
            ->action(function (Section $component, EditRecord $livewire) {
                $livewire->saveFormComponentOnly($component);
                
                Notification::make()
                    ->title('Rate limiting saved')
                    ->body('The rate limiting settings have been saved successfully.')
                    ->success()
                    ->send();
            })
            ->visible($operation === 'edit'),
    ])
```

The `$operation` helper is available, to ensure that the action is only visible when the form is being edited.

## Halting the saving process

At any time, you may call `$this->halt()` from inside a lifecycle hook or mutation method, which will halt the entire saving process:

```php
use Filament\Notifications\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Notifications\Notification;

protected function beforeSave(): void
{
    if (! $this->getRecord()->team->subscribed()) {
        Notification::make()
            ->warning()
            ->title('You don\'t have an active subscription!')
            ->body('Choose a plan to continue.')
            ->persistent()
            ->actions([
                Action::make('subscribe')
                    ->button()
                    ->url(route('subscribe'), shouldOpenInNewTab: true),
            ])
            ->send();

        $this->halt();
    }
}
```

Alternatively, if you're editing records in a modal action, check out the [Actions documentation](../../actions/prebuilt-actions/edit#halting-the-saving-process).

## Authorization

For authorization, Filament will observe any [model policies](https://laravel.com/docs/authorization#creating-policies) that are registered in your app.

Users may access the Edit page if the `update()` method of the model policy returns `true`.

They also have the ability to delete the record if the `delete()` method of the policy returns `true`.

## Custom actions

"Actions" are buttons that are displayed on pages, which allow the user to run a Livewire method on the page or visit a URL.

On resource pages, actions are usually in 2 places: in the top right of the page, and below the form.

For example, you may add a new button action next to "Delete" on the Edit page:

```php
use Filament\Actions;
use Filament\Resources\Pages\EditRecord;

class EditUser extends EditRecord
{
    // ...

    protected function getHeaderActions(): array
    {
        return [
            Actions\Action::make('impersonate')
                ->action(function (): void {
                    // ...
                }),
            Actions\DeleteAction::make(),
        ];
    }
}
```

Or, a new button next to "Save" below the form:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Resources\Pages\EditRecord;

class EditUser extends EditRecord
{
    // ...

    protected function getFormActions(): array
    {
        return [
            ...parent::getFormActions(),
            Action::make('close')->action('saveAndClose'),
        ];
    }

    public function saveAndClose(): void
    {
        // ...
    }
}
```

To view the entire actions API, please visit the [pages section](../pages#adding-actions-to-pages).

### Adding a save action button to the header

The "Save" button can be added to the header of the page by overriding the `getHeaderActions()` method and using `getSaveFormAction()`. You need to pass `formId()` to the action, to specify that the action should submit the form with the ID of `form`, which is the `<form>` ID used in the view of the page:

```php
protected function getHeaderActions(): array
{
    return [
        $this->getSaveFormAction()
            ->formId('form'),
    ];
}
```

You may remove all actions from the form by overriding the `getFormActions()` method to return an empty array:

```php
protected function getFormActions(): array
{
    return [];
}
```

## Creating another Edit page

One Edit page may not be enough space to allow users to navigate many form fields. You can create as many Edit pages for a resource as you want. This is especially useful if you are using [resource sub-navigation](getting-started#resource-sub-navigation), as you are then easily able to switch between the different Edit pages.

To create an Edit page, you should use the `make:filament-page` command:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-page EditCustomerContact --resource=CustomerResource --type=EditRecord
```

You must register this new page in your resource's `getPages()` method:

```php
public static function getPages(): array
{
    return [
        'index' => Pages\ListCustomers::route('/'),
        'create' => Pages\CreateCustomer::route('/create'),
        'view' => Pages\ViewCustomer::route('/{record}'),
        'edit' => Pages\EditCustomer::route('/{record}/edit'),
        'edit-contact' => Pages\EditCustomerContact::route('/{record}/edit/contact'),
    ];
}
```

Now, you can define the `form()` for this page, which can contain other fields that are not present on the main Edit page:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Form;

public function form(Form $form): Form
{
    return $form
        ->schema([
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

## Adding edit pages to resource sub-navigation

If you're using [resource sub-navigation](getting-started#resource-sub-navigation), you can register this page as normal in `getRecordSubNavigation()` of the resource:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\CustomerResource\Pages;
use Filament\Resources\Pages\Page;

public static function getRecordSubNavigation(Page $page): array
{
    return $page->generateNavigationItems([
        // ...
        Pages\EditCustomerContact::class,
    ]);
}
```

## Custom views

For further customization opportunities, you can override the static `$view` property on the page class to a custom view in your app:

```php
protected static string $view = 'filament.resources.users.pages.edit-user';
```

This assumes that you have created a view at `resources/views/filament/resources/users/pages/edit-user.blade.php`.

Here's a basic example of what that view might contain:

```blade
<x-filament-panels::page>
    <x-filament-panels::form wire:submit="save">
        {{ $this->form }}

        <x-filament-panels::form.actions
            :actions="$this->getCachedFormActions()"
            :full-width="$this->hasFullWidthFormActions()"
        />
    </x-filament-panels::form>

    @if (count($relationManagers = $this->getRelationManagers()))
        <x-filament-panels::resources.relation-managers
            :active-manager="$this->activeRelationManager"
            :managers="$relationManagers"
            :owner-record="$record"
            :page-class="static::class"
        />
    @endif
</x-filament-panels::page>
```

To see everything that the default view contains, you can check the `vendor/filament/filament/resources/views/resources/pages/edit-record.blade.php` file in your project.

import LaracastsBanner from "@components/LaracastsBanner.astro"

## Creating a resource with a View page

To create a new resource with a View page, you can use the `--view` flag:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-resource User --view
```

## Using an infolist instead of a disabled form

<LaracastsBanner
    title="Infolists"
    description="Watch the Rapid Laravel Development with Filament series on Laracasts - it will teach you the basics of adding infolists to Filament resources."
    url="https://laracasts.com/series/rapid-laravel-development-with-filament/episodes/12"
    series="rapid-laravel-development"
/>

By default, the View page will display a disabled form with the record's data. If you preferred to display the record's data in an "infolist", you can define an `infolist()` method on the resource class:

```php
use Filament\Infolists;
use Filament\Infolists\Infolist;

public static function infolist(Infolist $infolist): Infolist
{
    return $infolist
        ->schema([
            Infolists\Components\TextEntry::make('name'),
            Infolists\Components\TextEntry::make('email'),
            Infolists\Components\TextEntry::make('notes')
                ->columnSpanFull(),
        ]);
}
```

The `schema()` method is used to define the structure of your infolist. It is an array of [entries](../../infolists/entries/getting-started#available-entries) and [layout components](../../infolists/layout/getting-started#available-layout-components), in the order they should appear in your infolist.

Check out the Infolists docs for a [guide](../../infolists/getting-started) on how to build infolists with Filament.

## Adding a View page to an existing resource

If you want to add a View page to an existing resource, create a new page in your resource's `Pages` directory:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-page ViewUser --resource=UserResource --type=ViewRecord
```

You must register this new page in your resource's `getPages()` method:

```php
public static function getPages(): array
{
    return [
        'index' => Pages\ListUsers::route('/'),
        'create' => Pages\CreateUser::route('/create'),
        'view' => Pages\ViewUser::route('/{record}'),
        'edit' => Pages\EditUser::route('/{record}/edit'),
    ];
}
```

## Viewing records in modals

If your resource is simple, you may wish to view records in modals rather than on the [View page](viewing-records). If this is the case, you can just [delete the view page](getting-started#deleting-resource-pages).

If your resource doesn't contain a `ViewAction`, you can add one to the `$table->actions()` array:

```php
use Filament\Tables;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public static function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            // ...
        ])
        ->actions([
            Tables\Actions\ViewAction::make(),
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

## Customizing data before filling the form

You may wish to modify the data from a record before it is filled into the form. To do this, you may define a `mutateFormDataBeforeFill()` method on the View page class to modify the `$data` array, and return the modified version before it is filled into the form:

```php
protected function mutateFormDataBeforeFill(array $data): array
{
    $data['user_id'] = auth()->id();

    return $data;
}
```

Alternatively, if you're viewing records in a modal action, check out the [Actions documentation](../../actions/prebuilt-actions/view#customizing-data-before-filling-the-form).

## Lifecycle hooks

Hooks may be used to execute code at various points within a page's lifecycle, like before a form is filled. To set up a hook, create a protected method on the View page class with the name of the hook:

```php
use Filament\Resources\Pages\ViewRecord;

class ViewUser extends ViewRecord
{
    // ...

    protected function beforeFill(): void
    {
        // Runs before the disabled form fields are populated from the database. Not run on pages using an infolist.
    }

    protected function afterFill(): void
    {
        // Runs after the disabled form fields are populated from the database. Not run on pages using an infolist.
    }
}
```

## Authorization

For authorization, Filament will observe any [model policies](https://laravel.com/docs/authorization#creating-policies) that are registered in your app.

Users may access the View page if the `view()` method of the model policy returns `true`.

## Creating another View page

One View page may not be enough space to allow users to navigate a lot of information. You can create as many View pages for a resource as you want. This is especially useful if you are using [resource sub-navigation](getting-started#resource-sub-navigation), as you are then easily able to switch between the different View pages.

To create a View page, you should use the `make:filament-page` command:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-page ViewCustomerContact --resource=CustomerResource --type=ViewRecord
```

You must register this new page in your resource's `getPages()` method:

```php
public static function getPages(): array
{
    return [
        'index' => Pages\ListCustomers::route('/'),
        'create' => Pages\CreateCustomer::route('/create'),
        'view' => Pages\ViewCustomer::route('/{record}'),
        'view-contact' => Pages\ViewCustomerContact::route('/{record}/contact'),
        'edit' => Pages\EditCustomer::route('/{record}/edit'),
    ];
}
```

Now, you can define the `infolist()` or `form()` for this page, which can contain other components that are not present on the main View page:

```php
use Filament\Infolists\Infolist;

public function infolist(Infolist $infolist): Infolist
{
    return $infolist
        ->schema([
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

## Adding view pages to resource sub-navigation

If you're using [resource sub-navigation](getting-started#resource-sub-navigation), you can register this page as normal in `getRecordSubNavigation()` of the resource:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\CustomerResource\Pages;
use Filament\Resources\Pages\Page;

public static function getRecordSubNavigation(Page $page): array
{
    return $page->generateNavigationItems([
        // ...
        Pages\ViewCustomerContact::class,
    ]);
}
```

## Custom view

For further customization opportunities, you can override the static `$view` property on the page class to a custom view in your app:

```php
protected static string $view = 'filament.resources.users.pages.view-user';
```

This assumes that you have created a view at `resources/views/filament/resources/users/pages/view-user.blade.php`.

Here's a basic example of what that view might contain:

```blade
<x-filament-panels::page>
    @if ($this->hasInfolist())
        {{ $this->infolist }}
    @else
        {{ $this->form }}

## Handling soft deletes

## Creating a resource with soft delete

By default, you will not be able to interact with deleted records in the app. If you'd like to add functionality to restore, force delete and filter trashed records in your resource, use the `--soft-deletes` flag when generating the resource:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-resource Customer --soft-deletes
```

## Adding soft deletes to an existing resource

Alternatively, you may add soft deleting functionality to an existing resource.

Firstly, you must update the resource:

```php
use Filament\Tables;
use Filament\Tables\Table;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\SoftDeletingScope;

public static function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            // ...
        ])
        ->filters([
            Tables\Filters\TrashedFilter::make(),
            // ...
        ])
        ->actions([
            // You may add these actions to your table if you're using a simple
            // resource, or you just want to be able to delete records without
            // leaving the table.
            Tables\Actions\DeleteAction::make(),
            Tables\Actions\ForceDeleteAction::make(),
            Tables\Actions\RestoreAction::make(),
            // ...
        ])
        ->bulkActions([
            Tables\Actions\BulkActionGroup::make([
                Tables\Actions\DeleteBulkAction::make(),
                Tables\Actions\ForceDeleteBulkAction::make(),
                Tables\Actions\RestoreBulkAction::make(),
                // ...
            ]),
        ]);
}

public static function getEloquentQuery(): Builder
{
    return parent::getEloquentQuery()
        ->withoutGlobalScopes([
            SoftDeletingScope::class,
        ]);
}
```

Now, update the Edit page class if you have one:

```php
use Filament\Actions;

protected function getHeaderActions(): array
{
    return [
        Actions\DeleteAction::make(),
        Actions\ForceDeleteAction::make(),
        Actions\RestoreAction::make(),
        // ...
    ];
}
```

## Deleting records on the List page

By default, you can bulk-delete records in your table. You may also wish to delete single records, using a `DeleteAction`:

```php
use Filament\Tables;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public static function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            // ...
        ])
        ->actions([
            // ...
            Tables\Actions\DeleteAction::make(),
        ]);
}
```

## Authorization

For authorization, Filament will observe any [model policies](https://laravel.com/docs/authorization#creating-policies) that are registered in your app.

Users may delete records if the `delete()` method of the model policy returns `true`.

They also have the ability to bulk-delete records if the `deleteAny()` method of the policy returns `true`. Filament uses the `deleteAny()` method because iterating through multiple records and checking the `delete()` policy is not very performant.

### Authorizing soft deletes

The `forceDelete()` policy method is used to prevent a single soft-deleted record from being force-deleted. `forceDeleteAny()` is used to prevent records from being bulk force-deleted. Filament uses the `forceDeleteAny()` method because iterating through multiple records and checking the `forceDelete()` policy is not very performant.

The `restore()` policy method is used to prevent a single soft-deleted record from being restored. `restoreAny()` is used to prevent records from being bulk restored. Filament uses the `restoreAny()` method because iterating through multiple records and checking the `restore()` policy is not very performant.

## Choosing the right tool for the job

Filament provides many ways to manage relationships in the app. Which feature you should use depends on the type of relationship you are managing, and which UI you are looking for.

### Relation managers - interactive tables underneath your resource forms

> These are compatible with `HasMany`, `HasManyThrough`, `BelongsToMany`, `MorphMany` and `MorphToMany` relationships.

[Relation managers](#creating-a-relation-manager) are interactive tables that allow administrators to list, create, attach, associate, edit, detach, dissociate and delete related records without leaving the resource's Edit or View page.

### Select & checkbox list - choose from existing records or create a new one

> These are compatible with `BelongsTo`, `MorphTo` and `BelongsToMany` relationships.

Using a [select](../../forms/fields/select#integrating-with-an-eloquent-relationship), users will be able to choose from a list of existing records. You may also [add a button that allows you to create a new record inside a modal](../../forms/fields/select#creating-new-records), without leaving the page.

When using a `BelongsToMany` relationship with a select, you'll be able to select multiple options, not just one. Records will be automatically added to your pivot table when you submit the form. If you wish, you can swap out the multi-select dropdown with a simple [checkbox list](../../forms/fields/checkbox-list#integrating-with-an-eloquent-relationship). Both components work in the same way.

### Repeaters - CRUD multiple related records inside the owner's form

> These are compatible with `HasMany` and `MorphMany` relationships.

[Repeaters](../../forms/fields/repeater#integrating-with-an-eloquent-relationship) are standard form components, which can render a repeatable set of fields infinitely. They can be hooked up to a relationship, so records are automatically read, created, updated, and deleted from the related table. They live inside the main form schema, and can be used inside resource pages, as well as nesting within action modals.

From a UX perspective, this solution is only suitable if your related model only has a few fields. Otherwise, the form can get very long.

### Layout form components - saving form fields to a single relationship

> These are compatible with `BelongsTo`, `HasOne` and `MorphOne` relationships.

All layout form components ([Grid](../../forms/layout/grid#grid-component), [Section](../../forms/layout/section), [Fieldset](../../forms/layout/fieldset), etc.) have a [`relationship()` method](../../forms/advanced#saving-data-to-relationships). When you use this, all fields within that layout are saved to the related model instead of the owner's model:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Fieldset;
use Filament\Forms\Components\FileUpload;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Textarea;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;

Fieldset::make('Metadata')
    ->relationship('metadata')
    ->schema([
        TextInput::make('title'),
        Textarea::make('description'),
        FileUpload::make('image'),
    ])
```

In this example, the `title`, `description` and `image` are automatically loaded from the `metadata` relationship, and saved again when the form is submitted. If the `metadata` record does not exist, it is automatically created.

This feature is explained more in depth in the [Forms documentation](../../forms/advanced#saving-data-to-relationships). Please visit that page for more information about how to use it.

## Creating a relation manager

<LaracastsBanner
    title="Relation Managers"
    description="Watch the Rapid Laravel Development with Filament series on Laracasts - it will teach you the basics of adding relation managers to Filament resources."
    url="https://laracasts.com/series/rapid-laravel-development-with-filament/episodes/13"
    series="rapid-laravel-development"
/>

To create a relation manager, you can use the `make:filament-relation-manager` command:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-relation-manager CategoryResource posts title
```

- `CategoryResource` is the name of the resource class for the owner (parent) model.
- `posts` is the name of the relationship you want to manage.
- `title` is the name of the attribute that will be used to identify posts.

This will create a `CategoryResource/RelationManagers/PostsRelationManager.php` file. This contains a class where you are able to define a [form](getting-started#resource-forms) and [table](getting-started#resource-tables) for your relation manager:

```php
use Filament\Forms;
use Filament\Forms\Form;
use Filament\Tables;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function form(Form $form): Form
{
    return $form
        ->schema([
            Forms\Components\TextInput::make('title')->required(),
            // ...
        ]);
}

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            Tables\Columns\TextColumn::make('title'),
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

You must register the new relation manager in your resource's `getRelations()` method:

```php
public static function getRelations(): array
{
    return [
        RelationManagers\PostsRelationManager::class,
    ];
}
```

Once a table and form have been defined for the relation manager, visit the [Edit](editing-records) or [View](viewing-records) page of your resource to see it in action.

### Read-only mode

Relation managers are usually displayed on either the Edit or View page of a resource. On the View page, Filament will automatically hide all actions that modify the relationship, such as create, edit, and delete. We call this "read-only mode", and it is there by default to preserve the read-only behavior of the View page. However, you can disable this behavior, by overriding the `isReadOnly()` method on the relation manager class to return `false` all the time:

```php
public function isReadOnly(): bool
{
    return false;
}
```

Alternatively, if you hate this functionality, you can disable it for all relation managers at once in the panel [configuration](../configuration):

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->readOnlyRelationManagersOnResourceViewPagesByDefault(false);
}
```

### Unconventional inverse relationship names

For inverse relationships that do not follow Laravel's naming guidelines, you may wish to use the `inverseRelationship()` method on the table:

```php
use Filament\Tables;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            Tables\Columns\TextColumn::make('title'),
            // ...
        ])
        ->inverseRelationship('section'); // Since the inverse related model is `Category`, this is normally `category`, not `section`.
}
```

### Handling soft deletes

By default, you will not be able to interact with deleted records in the relation manager. If you'd like to add functionality to restore, force delete and filter trashed records in your relation manager, use the `--soft-deletes` flag when generating the relation manager:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-relation-manager CategoryResource posts title --soft-deletes
```

You can find out more about soft deleting [here](#deleting-records).

## Listing related records

Related records will be listed in a table. The entire relation manager is based around this table, which contains actions to [create](#creating-related-records), [edit](#editing-related-records), [attach / detach](#attaching-and-detaching-records), [associate / dissociate](#associating-and-dissociating-records), and delete records.

You may use any features of the [Table Builder](../../tables) to customize relation managers.

### Listing with pivot attributes

For `BelongsToMany` and `MorphToMany` relationships, you may also add pivot table attributes. For example, if you have a `TeamsRelationManager` for your `UserResource`, and you want to add the `role` pivot attribute to the table, you can use:

```php
use Filament\Tables;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            Tables\Columns\TextColumn::make('name'),
            Tables\Columns\TextColumn::make('role'),
        ]);
}
```

Please ensure that any pivot attributes are listed in the `withPivot()` method of the relationship *and* inverse relationship.

## Creating related records

### Creating with pivot attributes

For `BelongsToMany` and `MorphToMany` relationships, you may also add pivot table attributes. For example, if you have a `TeamsRelationManager` for your `UserResource`, and you want to add the `role` pivot attribute to the create form, you can use:

```php
use Filament\Forms;
use Filament\Forms\Form;

public function form(Form $form): Form
{
    return $form
        ->schema([
            Forms\Components\TextInput::make('name')->required(),
            Forms\Components\TextInput::make('role')->required(),
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

Please ensure that any pivot attributes are listed in the `withPivot()` method of the relationship *and* inverse relationship.

### Customizing the `CreateAction`

To learn how to customize the `CreateAction`, including mutating the form data, changing the notification, and adding lifecycle hooks, please see the [Actions documentation](../../actions/prebuilt-actions/create).

## Editing related records

### Editing with pivot attributes

For `BelongsToMany` and `MorphToMany` relationships, you may also edit pivot table attributes. For example, if you have a `TeamsRelationManager` for your `UserResource`, and you want to add the `role` pivot attribute to the edit form, you can use:

```php
use Filament\Forms;
use Filament\Forms\Form;

public function form(Form $form): Form
{
    return $form
        ->schema([
            Forms\Components\TextInput::make('name')->required(),
            Forms\Components\TextInput::make('role')->required(),
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

Please ensure that any pivot attributes are listed in the `withPivot()` method of the relationship *and* inverse relationship.

### Customizing the `EditAction`

To learn how to customize the `EditAction`, including mutating the form data, changing the notification, and adding lifecycle hooks, please see the [Actions documentation](../../actions/prebuilt-actions/edit).

## Attaching and detaching records

Filament is able to attach and detach records for `BelongsToMany` and `MorphToMany` relationships.

When generating your relation manager, you may pass the `--attach` flag to also add `AttachAction`, `DetachAction` and `DetachBulkAction` to the table:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-relation-manager CategoryResource posts title --attach
```

Alternatively, if you've already generated your resource, you can just add the actions to the `$table` arrays:

```php
use Filament\Tables;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            // ...
        ])
        ->headerActions([
            // ...
            Tables\Actions\AttachAction::make(),
        ])
        ->actions([
            // ...
            Tables\Actions\DetachAction::make(),
        ])
        ->bulkActions([
            Tables\Actions\BulkActionGroup::make([
                // ...
                Tables\Actions\DetachBulkAction::make(),
            ]),
        ]);
}
```

### Preloading the attachment modal select options

By default, as you search for a record to attach, options will load from the database via AJAX. If you wish to preload these options when the form is first loaded instead, you can use the `preloadRecordSelect()` method of `AttachAction`:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Actions\AttachAction;

AttachAction::make()
    ->preloadRecordSelect()
```

### Attaching with pivot attributes

When you attach record with the `Attach` button, you may wish to define a custom form to add pivot attributes to the relationship:

```php
use Filament\Forms;
use Filament\Tables\Actions\AttachAction;

AttachAction::make()
    ->form(fn (AttachAction $action): array => [
        $action->getRecordSelect(),
        Forms\Components\TextInput::make('role')->required(),
    ])
```

In this example, `$action->getRecordSelect()` returns the select field to pick the record to attach. The `role` text input is then saved to the pivot table's `role` column.

Please ensure that any pivot attributes are listed in the `withPivot()` method of the relationship *and* inverse relationship.

### Scoping the options to attach

You may want to scope the options available to `AttachAction`:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Actions\AttachAction;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

AttachAction::make()
    ->recordSelectOptionsQuery(fn (Builder $query) => $query->whereBelongsTo(auth()->user()))
```

### Searching the options to attach across multiple columns

By default, the options available to `AttachAction` will be searched in the `recordTitleAttribute()` of the table. If you wish to search across multiple columns, you can use the `recordSelectSearchColumns()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Actions\AttachAction;

AttachAction::make()
    ->recordSelectSearchColumns(['title', 'description'])
```

### Attaching multiple records

The `multiple()` method on the `AttachAction` component allows you to select multiple values:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Actions\AttachAction;

AttachAction::make()
    ->multiple()
```

### Customizing the select field in the attached modal

You may customize the select field object that is used during attachment by passing a function to the `recordSelect()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;
use Filament\Tables\Actions\AttachAction;

AttachAction::make()
    ->recordSelect(
        fn (Select $select) => $select->placeholder('Select a post'),
    )
```

### Handling duplicates

By default, you will not be allowed to attach a record more than once. This is because you must also set up a primary `id` column on the pivot table for this feature to work.

Please ensure that the `id` attribute is listed in the `withPivot()` method of the relationship *and* inverse relationship.

Finally, add the `allowDuplicates()` method to the table:

```php
public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->allowDuplicates();
}
```

## Associating and dissociating records

Filament is able to associate and dissociate records for `HasMany` and `MorphMany` relationships.

When generating your relation manager, you may pass the `--associate` flag to also add `AssociateAction`, `DissociateAction` and `DissociateBulkAction` to the table:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-relation-manager CategoryResource posts title --associate
```

Alternatively, if you've already generated your resource, you can just add the actions to the `$table` arrays:

```php
use Filament\Tables;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            // ...
        ])
        ->headerActions([
            // ...
            Tables\Actions\AssociateAction::make(),
        ])
        ->actions([
            // ...
            Tables\Actions\DissociateAction::make(),
        ])
        ->bulkActions([
            Tables\Actions\BulkActionGroup::make([
                // ...
                Tables\Actions\DissociateBulkAction::make(),
            ]),
        ]);
}
```

### Preloading the associate modal select options

By default, as you search for a record to associate, options will load from the database via AJAX. If you wish to preload these options when the form is first loaded instead, you can use the `preloadRecordSelect()` method of `AssociateAction`:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Actions\AssociateAction;

AssociateAction::make()
    ->preloadRecordSelect()
```

### Scoping the options to associate

You may want to scope the options available to `AssociateAction`:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Actions\AssociateAction;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

AssociateAction::make()
    ->recordSelectOptionsQuery(fn (Builder $query) => $query->whereBelongsTo(auth()->user()))
```

### Searching the options to associate across multiple columns

By default, the options available to `AssociateAction` will be searched in the `recordTitleAttribute()` of the table. If you wish to search across multiple columns, you can use the `recordSelectSearchColumns()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Actions\AssociateAction;

AssociateAction::make()
    ->recordSelectSearchColumns(['title', 'description'])
```

### Associating multiple records

The `multiple()` method on the `AssociateAction` component allows you to select multiple values:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Actions\AssociateAction;

AssociateAction::make()
    ->multiple()
```

### Customizing the select field in the associate modal

You may customize the select field object that is used during association by passing a function to the `recordSelect()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;
use Filament\Tables\Actions\AssociateAction;

AssociateAction::make()
    ->recordSelect(
        fn (Select $select) => $select->placeholder('Select a post'),
    )
```

## Viewing related records

When generating your relation manager, you may pass the `--view` flag to also add a `ViewAction` to the table:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-relation-manager CategoryResource posts title --view
```

Alternatively, if you've already generated your relation manager, you can just add the `ViewAction` to the `$table->actions()` array:

```php
use Filament\Tables;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            // ...
        ])
        ->actions([
            Tables\Actions\ViewAction::make(),
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

## Deleting related records

By default, you will not be able to interact with deleted records in the relation manager. If you'd like to add functionality to restore, force delete and filter trashed records in your relation manager, use the `--soft-deletes` flag when generating the relation manager:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-relation-manager CategoryResource posts title --soft-deletes
```

Alternatively, you may add soft deleting functionality to an existing relation manager:

```php
use Filament\Tables;
use Filament\Tables\Table;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\SoftDeletingScope;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->modifyQueryUsing(fn (Builder $query) => $query->withoutGlobalScopes([
            SoftDeletingScope::class,
        ]))
        ->columns([
            // ...
        ])
        ->filters([
            Tables\Filters\TrashedFilter::make(),
            // ...
        ])
        ->actions([
            Tables\Actions\DeleteAction::make(),
            Tables\Actions\ForceDeleteAction::make(),
            Tables\Actions\RestoreAction::make(),
            // ...
        ])
        ->bulkActions([
            BulkActionGroup::make([
                Tables\Actions\DeleteBulkAction::make(),
                Tables\Actions\ForceDeleteBulkAction::make(),
                Tables\Actions\RestoreBulkAction::make(),
                // ...
            ]),
        ]);
}
```

### Customizing the `DeleteAction`

To learn how to customize the `DeleteAction`, including changing the notification and adding lifecycle hooks, please see the [Actions documentation](../../actions/prebuilt-actions/delete).

## Importing related records

The [`ImportAction`](../../actions/prebuilt-actions/import) can be added to the header of a relation manager to import records. In this case, you probably want to tell the importer which owner these new records belong to. You can use [import options](../../actions/prebuilt-actions/import#using-import-options) to pass through the ID of the owner record:

```php
ImportAction::make()
    ->importer(ProductImporter::class)
    ->options(['categoryId' => $this->getOwnerRecord()->getKey()])
```

Now, in the importer class, you can associate the owner in a one-to-many relationship with the imported record:

```php
public function resolveRecord(): ?Product
{
    $product = Product::firstOrNew([
        'sku' => $this->data['sku'],
    ]);
    
    $product->category()->associate($this->options['categoryId']);
    
    return $product;
}
```

Alternatively, you can attach the record in a many-to-many relationship using the `afterSave()` hook of the importer:

```php
protected function afterSave(): void
{
    $this->record->categories()->syncWithoutDetaching([$this->options['categoryId']]);
}
```

## Accessing the relationship's owner record

Relation managers are Livewire components. When they are first loaded, the owner record (the Eloquent record which serves as a parent - the main resource model) is saved into a property. You can read this property using:

```php
$this->getOwnerRecord()
```

However, if you're inside a `static` method like `form()` or `table()`, `$this` isn't accessible. So, you may [use a callback](../../forms/advanced#form-component-utility-injection) to access the `$livewire` instance:

```php
use Filament\Forms;
use Filament\Forms\Form;
use Filament\Resources\RelationManagers\RelationManager;

public function form(Form $form): Form
{
    return $form
        ->schema([
            Forms\Components\Select::make('store_id')
                ->options(function (RelationManager $livewire): array {
                    return $livewire->getOwnerRecord()->stores()
                        ->pluck('name', 'id')
                        ->toArray();
                }),
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

All methods in Filament accept a callback which you can access `$livewire->ownerRecord` in.

## Grouping relation managers

You may choose to group relation managers together into one tab. To do this, you may wrap multiple managers in a `RelationGroup` object, with a label:

```php
use Filament\Resources\RelationManagers\RelationGroup;

public static function getRelations(): array
{
    return [
        // ...
        RelationGroup::make('Contacts', [
            RelationManagers\IndividualsRelationManager::class,
            RelationManagers\OrganizationsRelationManager::class,
        ]),
        // ...
    ];
}
```

## Conditionally showing relation managers

By default, relation managers will be visible if the `viewAny()` method for the related model policy returns `true`.

You may use the `canViewForRecord()` method to determine if the relation manager should be visible for a specific owner record and page:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

public static function canViewForRecord(Model $ownerRecord, string $pageClass): bool
{
    return $ownerRecord->status === Status::Draft;
}
```

## Combining the relation manager tabs with the form

On the Edit or View page class, override the `hasCombinedRelationManagerTabsWithContent()` method:

```php
public function hasCombinedRelationManagerTabsWithContent(): bool
{
    return true;
}
```

### Setting an icon for the form tab

On the Edit or View page class, override the `getContentTabIcon()` method:

```php
public function getContentTabIcon(): ?string
{
    return 'heroicon-m-cog';
}
```

### Setting the position of the form tab

By default, the form tab is rendered before the relation tabs. To render it after, you can override the `getContentTabPosition()` method on the Edit or View page class:

```php
use Filament\Resources\Pages\ContentTabPosition;

public function getContentTabPosition(): ?ContentTabPosition
{
    return ContentTabPosition::After;
}
```

## Adding badges to relation manager tabs

You can add a badge to a relation manager tab by setting the `$badge` property:

```php
protected static ?string $badge = 'new';
```

Alternatively, you can override the `getBadge()` method:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

public static function getBadge(Model $ownerRecord, string $pageClass): ?string
{
    return static::$badge;
}
```

Or, if you are using a [relation group](#grouping-relation-managers), you can use the `badge()` method:

```php
use Filament\Resources\RelationManagers\RelationGroup;

RelationGroup::make('Contacts', [
    // ...
])->badge('new');
```

### Changing the color of relation manager tab badges

If a badge value is defined, it will display using the primary color by default. To style the badge contextually, set the `$badgeColor` to either `danger`, `gray`, `info`, `primary`, `success` or `warning`:

```php
protected static ?string $badgeColor = 'danger';
```

Alternatively, you can override the `getBadgeColor()` method:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

public static function getBadgeColor(Model $ownerRecord, string $pageClass): ?string
{
    return 'danger';
}
```

Or, if you are using a [relation group](#grouping-relation-managers), you can use the `badgeColor()` method:

```php
use Filament\Resources\RelationManagers\RelationGroup;

RelationGroup::make('Contacts', [
    // ...
])->badgeColor('danger');
```

### Adding a tooltip to relation manager tab badges

If a badge value is defined, you can add a tooltip to it by setting the `$badgeTooltip` property:

```php
protected static ?string $badgeTooltip = 'There are new posts';
```

Alternatively, you can override the `getBadgeTooltip()` method:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

public static function getBadgeTooltip(Model $ownerRecord, string $pageClass): ?string
{
    return 'There are new posts';
}
```

Or, if you are using a [relation group](#grouping-relation-managers), you can use the `badgeTooltip()` method:

```php
use Filament\Resources\RelationManagers\RelationGroup;

RelationGroup::make('Contacts', [
    // ...
])->badgeTooltip('There are new posts');
```

## Sharing a resource's form and table with a relation manager

You may decide that you want a resource's form and table to be identical to a relation manager's, and subsequently want to reuse the code you previously wrote. This is easy, by calling the `form()` and `table()` methods of the resource from the relation manager:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\Blog\PostResource;
use Filament\Forms\Form;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function form(Form $form): Form
{
    return PostResource::form($form);
}

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return PostResource::table($table);
}
```

### Hiding a shared form component on the relation manager

If you're sharing a form component from the resource with the relation manager, you may want to hide it on the relation manager. This is especially useful if you want to hide a `Select` field for the owner record in the relation manager, since Filament will handle this for you anyway. To do this, you may use the `hiddenOn()` method, passing the name of the relation manager:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\Blog\PostResource\RelationManagers\CommentsRelationManager;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;

Select::make('post_id')
    ->relationship('post', 'title')
    ->hiddenOn(CommentsRelationManager::class)
```

### Hiding a shared table column on the relation manager

If you're sharing a table column from the resource with the relation manager, you may want to hide it on the relation manager. This is especially useful if you want to hide a column for the owner record in the relation manager, since this is not appropriate when the owner record is already listed above the relation manager. To do this, you may use the `hiddenOn()` method, passing the name of the relation manager:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\Blog\PostResource\RelationManagers\CommentsRelationManager;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('post.title')
    ->hiddenOn(CommentsRelationManager::class)
```

### Hiding a shared table filter on the relation manager

If you're sharing a table filter from the resource with the relation manager, you may want to hide it on the relation manager. This is especially useful if you want to hide a filter for the owner record in the relation manager, since this is not appropriate when the table is already filtered by the owner record. To do this, you may use the `hiddenOn()` method, passing the name of the relation manager:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\Blog\PostResource\RelationManagers\CommentsRelationManager;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\SelectFilter;

SelectFilter::make('post')
    ->relationship('post', 'title')
    ->hiddenOn(CommentsRelationManager::class)
```

### Overriding shared configuration on the relation manager

Any configuration that you make inside the resource can be overwritten on the relation manager. For example, if you wanted to disable pagination on the relation manager's inherited table but not the resource itself:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\Blog\PostResource;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return PostResource::table($table)
        ->paginated(false);
}
```

It is probably also useful to provide extra configuration on the relation manager if you wanted to add a header action to [create](#creating-related-records), [attach](#attaching-and-detaching-records), or [associate](#associating-and-dissociating-records) records in the relation manager:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\Blog\PostResource;
use Filament\Tables;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return PostResource::table($table)
        ->headerActions([
            Tables\Actions\CreateAction::make(),
            Tables\Actions\AttachAction::make(),
        ]);
}
```

## Customizing the relation manager Eloquent query

You can apply your own query constraints or [model scopes](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent#query-scopes) that affect the entire relation manager. To do this, you can pass a function to the `modifyQueryUsing()` method of the table, inside which you can customize the query:

```php
use Filament\Tables;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->modifyQueryUsing(fn (Builder $query) => $query->where('is_active', true))
        ->columns([
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

## Customizing the relation manager title

To set the title of the relation manager, you can use the `$title` property on the relation manager class:

```php
protected static ?string $title = 'Posts';
```

To set the title of the relation manager dynamically, you can override the `getTitle()` method on the relation manager class:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

public static function getTitle(Model $ownerRecord, string $pageClass): string
{
    return __('relation-managers.posts.title');
}
```

The title will be reflected in the [heading of the table](../../tables/advanced#customizing-the-table-header), as well as the relation manager tab if there is more than one. If you want to customize the table heading independently, you can still use the `$table->heading()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->heading('Posts')
        ->columns([
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

## Customizing the relation manager record title

The relation manager uses the concept of a "record title attribute" to determine which attribute of the related model should be used to identify it. When creating a relation manager, this attribute is passed as the third argument to the `make:filament-relation-manager` command:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-relation-manager CategoryResource posts title
```

In this example, the `title` attribute of the `Post` model will be used to identify a post in the relation manager.

This is mainly used by the action classes. For instance, when you [attach](#attaching-and-detaching-records) or [associate](#associating-and-dissociating-records) a record, the titles will be listed in the select field. When you [edit](#editing-related-records), [view](#viewing-related-records) or [delete](#deleting-related-records) a record, the title will be used in the header of the modal.

In some cases, you may want to concatenate multiple attributes together to form a title. You can do this by replacing the `recordTitleAttribute()` configuration method with `recordTitle()`, passing a function that transforms a model into a title:

```php
use App\Models\Post;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->recordTitle(fn (Post $record): string => "{$record->title} ({$record->id})")
        ->columns([
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

If you're using `recordTitle()`, and you have an [associate action](#associating-and-dissociating-records) or [attach action](#attaching-and-detaching-records), you will also want to specify search columns for those actions:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Actions\AssociateAction;
use Filament\Tables\Actions\AttachAction;

AssociateAction::make()
    ->recordSelectSearchColumns(['title', 'id']);

AttachAction::make()
    ->recordSelectSearchColumns(['title', 'id'])
```

## Relation pages

Using a `ManageRelatedRecords` page is an alternative to using a relation manager, if you want to keep the functionality of managing a relationship separate from editing or viewing the owner record.

This feature is ideal if you are using [resource sub-navigation](getting-started#resource-sub-navigation), as you are easily able to switch between the View or Edit page and the relation page.

To create a relation page, you should use the `make:filament-page` command:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-page ManageCustomerAddresses --resource=CustomerResource --type=ManageRelatedRecords
```

When you run this command, you will be asked a series of questions to customize the page, for example, the name of the relationship and its title attribute.

You must register this new page in your resource's `getPages()` method:

```php
public static function getPages(): array
{
    return [
        'index' => Pages\ListCustomers::route('/'),
        'create' => Pages\CreateCustomer::route('/create'),
        'view' => Pages\ViewCustomer::route('/{record}'),
        'edit' => Pages\EditCustomer::route('/{record}/edit'),
        'addresses' => Pages\ManageCustomerAddresses::route('/{record}/addresses'),
    ];
}
```

> When using a relation page, you do not need to generate a relation manager with `make:filament-relation-manager`, and you do not need to register it in the `getRelations()` method of the resource.

Now, you can customize the page in exactly the same way as a relation manager, with the same `table()` and `form()`.

### Adding relation pages to resource sub-navigation

If you're using [resource sub-navigation](getting-started#resource-sub-navigation), you can register this page as normal in `getRecordSubNavigation()` of the resource:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\CustomerResource\Pages;
use Filament\Resources\Pages\Page;

public static function getRecordSubNavigation(Page $page): array
{
    return $page->generateNavigationItems([
        // ...
        Pages\ManageCustomerAddresses::class,
    ]);
}
```

## Passing properties to relation managers

When registering a relation manager in a resource, you can use the `make()` method to pass an array of [Livewire properties](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/properties) to it:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\Blog\PostResource\RelationManagers\CommentsRelationManager;

public static function getRelations(): array
{
    return [
        CommentsRelationManager::make([
            'status' => 'approved',
        ]),
    ];
}
```

This array of properties gets mapped to [public Livewire properties](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/properties) on the relation manager class:

```php
use Filament\Resources\RelationManagers\RelationManager;

class CommentsRelationManager extends RelationManager
{
    public string $status;

    // ...
}
```

Now, you can access the `status` in the relation manager class using `$this->status`.

## Disabling lazy loading

By default, relation managers are lazy-loaded. This means that they will only be loaded when they are visible on the page.

To disable this behavior, you may override the `$isLazy` property on the relation manager class:

```php
protected static bool $isLazy = false;
```

# Documentation for panels. File: 03-resources/08-global-search.md
---
title: Global search
---

## Overview

Global search allows you to search across all of your resource records, from anywhere in the app.

## Setting global search result titles

To enable global search on your model, you must [set a title attribute](getting-started#record-titles) for your resource:

```php
protected static ?string $recordTitleAttribute = 'title';
```

This attribute is used to retrieve the search result title for that record.

> Your resource needs to have an Edit or View page to allow the global search results to link to a URL, otherwise no results will be returned for this resource.

You may customize the title further by overriding `getGlobalSearchResultTitle()` method. It may return a plain text string, or an instance of `Illuminate\Support\HtmlString` or `Illuminate\Contracts\Support\Htmlable`. This allows you to render HTML, or even Markdown, in the search result title:

```php
use Illuminate\Contracts\Support\Htmlable;

public static function getGlobalSearchResultTitle(Model $record): string | Htmlable
{
    return $record->name;
}
```

## Globally searching across multiple columns

If you would like to search across multiple columns of your resource, you may override the `getGloballySearchableAttributes()` method. "Dot notation" allows you to search inside relationships:

```php
public static function getGloballySearchableAttributes(): array
{
    return ['title', 'slug', 'author.name', 'category.name'];
}
```

## Adding extra details to global search results

Search results can display "details" below their title, which gives the user more information about the record. To enable this feature, you must override the `getGlobalSearchResultDetails()` method:

```php
public static function getGlobalSearchResultDetails(Model $record): array
{
    return [
        'Author' => $record->author->name,
        'Category' => $record->category->name,
    ];
}
```

In this example, the category and author of the record will be displayed below its title in the search result. However, the `category` and `author` relationships will be lazy-loaded, which will result in poor results performance. To [eager-load](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-relationships#eager-loading) these relationships, we must override the `getGlobalSearchEloquentQuery()` method:

```php
public static function getGlobalSearchEloquentQuery(): Builder
{
    return parent::getGlobalSearchEloquentQuery()->with(['author', 'category']);
}
```

## Customizing global search result URLs

Global search results will link to the [Edit page](editing-records) of your resource, or the [View page](viewing-page) if the user does not have [edit permissions](editing-records#authorization). To customize this, you may override the `getGlobalSearchResultUrl()` method and return a route of your choice:

```php
public static function getGlobalSearchResultUrl(Model $record): string
{
    return UserResource::getUrl('edit', ['record' => $record]);
}
```

## Adding actions to global search results

Global search supports actions, which are buttons that render below each search result. They can open a URL or dispatch a Livewire event.

Actions can be defined as follows:

```php
use Filament\GlobalSearch\Actions\Action;

public static function getGlobalSearchResultActions(Model $record): array
{
    return [
        Action::make('edit')
            ->url(static::getUrl('edit', ['record' => $record])),
    ];
}
```

You can learn more about how to style action buttons [here](../../actions/trigger-button).

### Opening URLs from global search actions

You can open a URL, optionally in a new tab, when clicking on an action:

```php
use Filament\GlobalSearch\Actions\Action;

Action::make('view')
    ->url(static::getUrl('view', ['record' => $record]), shouldOpenInNewTab: true)
```

### Dispatching Livewire events from global search actions

Sometimes you want to execute additional code when a global search result action is clicked. This can be achieved by setting a Livewire event which should be dispatched on clicking the action. You may optionally pass an array of data, which will be available as parameters in the event listener on your Livewire component:

```php
use Filament\GlobalSearch\Actions\Action;

Action::make('quickView')
    ->dispatch('quickView', [$record->id])
```

## Limiting the number of global search results

By default, global search will return up to 50 results per resource. You can customize this on the resource label by overriding the `$globalSearchResultsLimit` property:

```php
protected static int $globalSearchResultsLimit = 20;
```

## Disabling global search

As [explained above](#title), global search is automatically enabled once you set a title attribute for your resource. Sometimes you may want to specify the title attribute while not enabling global search.

This can be achieved by disabling global search in the [configuration](configuration):

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->globalSearch(false);
}
```

## Registering global search key bindings

The global search field can be opened using keyboard shortcuts. To configure these, pass the `globalSearchKeyBindings()` method to the [configuration](configuration):

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->globalSearchKeyBindings(['command+k', 'ctrl+k']);
}
```

## Configuring the global search debounce

Global search has a default debounce time of 500ms, to limit the number of requests that are made while the user is typing. You can alter this by using the `globalSearchDebounce()` method in the [configuration](configuration):

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->globalSearchDebounce('750ms');
}
```

## Configuring the global search field suffix

Global search field by default doesn't include any suffix. You may customize it using the `globalSearchFieldSuffix()` method in the [configuration](configuration).

If you want to display the currently configured [global search key bindings](#registering-global-search-key-bindings) in the suffix, you can use the `globalSearchFieldKeyBindingSuffix()` method, which will display the first registered key binding as the suffix of the global search field:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->globalSearchFieldKeyBindingSuffix();
}
```

To customize the suffix yourself, you can pass a string or function to the `globalSearchFieldSuffix()` method. For example, to provide a custom key binding suffix for each platform manually:

```php
use Filament\Panel;
use Filament\Support\Enums\Platform;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->globalSearchFieldSuffix(fn (): ?string => match (Platform::detect()) {
            Platform::Windows, Platform::Linux => 'CTRL+K',
            Platform::Mac => '⌘K',
            default => null,
        });
}
```

# Documentation for panels. File: 03-resources/09-widgets.md

import LaracastsBanner from "@components/LaracastsBanner.astro"

## Overview

<LaracastsBanner
    title="Widgets"
    description="Watch the Rapid Laravel Development with Filament series on Laracasts - it will teach you the basics of adding widgets to Filament resources."
    url="https://laracasts.com/series/rapid-laravel-development-with-filament/episodes/15"
    series="rapid-laravel-development"
/>

Filament allows you to display widgets inside pages, below the header and above the footer.

You can use an existing [dashboard widget](../dashboard), or create one specifically for the resource.

## Creating a resource widget

To get started building a resource widget:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-widget CustomerOverview --resource=CustomerResource
```

This command will create two files - a widget class in the `app/Filament/Resources/CustomerResource/Widgets` directory, and a view in the `resources/views/filament/resources/customer-resource/widgets` directory.

You must register the new widget in your resource's `getWidgets()` method:

```php
public static function getWidgets(): array
{
    return [
        CustomerResource\Widgets\CustomerOverview::class,
    ];
}
```

If you'd like to learn how to build and customize widgets, check out the [Dashboard](../dashboard) documentation section.

## Displaying a widget on a resource page

To display a widget on a resource page, use the `getHeaderWidgets()` or `getFooterWidgets()` methods for that page:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Filament\Resources\CustomerResource\Pages;

use App\Filament\Resources\CustomerResource;

class ListCustomers extends ListRecords
{
    public static string $resource = CustomerResource::class;

    protected function getHeaderWidgets(): array
    {
        return [
            CustomerResource\Widgets\CustomerOverview::class,
        ];
    }
}
```

`getHeaderWidgets()` returns an array of widgets to display above the page content, whereas `getFooterWidgets()` are displayed below.

If you'd like to customize the number of grid columns used to arrange widgets, check out the [Pages documentation](../pages#customizing-the-widgets-grid).

## Accessing the current record in the widget

If you're using a widget on an [Edit](editing-records) or [View](viewing-records) page, you may access the current record by defining a `$record` property on the widget class:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

public ?Model $record = null;
```

## Accessing page table data in the widget

If you're using a widget on a [List](listing-records) page, you may access the table data by first adding the `ExposesTableToWidgets` trait to the page class:

```php
use Filament\Pages\Concerns\ExposesTableToWidgets;
use Filament\Resources\Pages\ListRecords;

class ListProducts extends ListRecords
{
    use ExposesTableToWidgets;

    // ...
}
```

Now, on the widget class, you must add the `InteractsWithPageTable` trait, and return the name of the page class from the `getTablePage()` method:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\ProductResource\Pages\ListProducts;
use Filament\Widgets\Concerns\InteractsWithPageTable;
use Filament\Widgets\Widget;

class ProductStats extends Widget
{
    use InteractsWithPageTable;

    protected function getTablePage(): string
    {
        return ListProducts::class;
    }

    // ...
}
```

In the widget class, you can now access the Eloquent query builder instance for the table data using the `$this->getPageTableQuery()` method:

```php
use Filament\Widgets\StatsOverviewWidget\Stat;

Stat::make('Total Products', $this->getPageTableQuery()->count()),
```

Alternatively, you can access a collection of the records on the current page using the `$this->getPageTableRecords()` method:

```php
use Filament\Widgets\StatsOverviewWidget\Stat;

Stat::make('Total Products', $this->getPageTableRecords()->count()),
```

## Passing properties to widgets on resource pages

When registering a widget on a resource page, you can use the `make()` method to pass an array of [Livewire properties](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/properties) to it:

```php
protected function getHeaderWidgets(): array
{
    return [
        CustomerResource\Widgets\CustomerOverview::make([
            'status' => 'active',
        ]),
    ];
}
```

This array of properties gets mapped to [public Livewire properties](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/properties) on the widget class:

```php
use Filament\Widgets\Widget;

class CustomerOverview extends Widget
{
    public string $status;

    // ...
}
```

Now, you can access the `status` in the widget class using `$this->status`.

# Documentation for panels. File: 03-resources/10-custom-pages.md
---
title: Custom pages
---

## Overview

Filament allows you to create completely custom pages for resources. To create a new page, you can use:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-page SortUsers --resource=UserResource --type=custom
```

This command will create two files - a page class in the `/Pages` directory of your resource directory, and a view in the `/pages` directory of the resource views directory.

You must register custom pages to a route in the static `getPages()` method of your resource:

```php
public static function getPages(): array
{
    return [
        // ...
        'sort' => Pages\SortUsers::route('/sort'),
    ];
}
```

> The order of pages registered in this method matters - any wildcard route segments that are defined before hard-coded ones will be matched by Laravel's router first.

Any [parameters](https://laravel.com/docs/routing#route-parameters) defined in the route's path will be available to the page class, in an identical way to [Livewire](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/components#accessing-route-parameters).

## Using a resource record

If you'd like to create a page that uses a record similar to the [Edit](editing-records) or [View](viewing-records) pages, you can use the `InteractsWithRecord` trait:

```php
use Filament\Resources\Pages\Page;
use Filament\Resources\Pages\Concerns\InteractsWithRecord;

class ManageUser extends Page
{
    use InteractsWithRecord;
    
    public function mount(int | string $record): void
    {
        $this->record = $this->resolveRecord($record);
    }

    // ...
}
```

The `mount()` method should resolve the record from the URL and store it in `$this->record`. You can access the record at any time using `$this->getRecord()` in the class or view.

To add the record to the route as a parameter, you must define `{record}` in `getPages()`:

```php
public static function getPages(): array
{
    return [
        // ...
        'manage' => Pages\ManageUser::route('/{record}/manage'),
    ];
}
```

## Protecting model attributes

Filament will expose all model attributes to JavaScript, except if they are `$hidden` on your model. This is Livewire's behavior for model binding. We preserve this functionality to facilitate the dynamic addition and removal of form fields after they are initially loaded, while preserving the data they may need.

> While attributes may be visible in JavaScript, only those with a form field are actually editable by the user. This is not an issue with mass assignment.

To remove certain attributes from JavaScript on the Edit and View pages, you may override [the `mutateFormDataBeforeFill()` method](editing-records#customizing-data-before-filling-the-form):

```php
protected function mutateFormDataBeforeFill(array $data): array
{
    unset($data['is_admin']);

    return $data;
}
```

In this example, we remove the `is_admin` attribute from JavaScript, as it's not being used by the form.

## Overview

Filament allows you to create completely custom pages for the app.

## Creating a page

To create a new page, you can use:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-page Settings
```

This command will create two files - a page class in the `/Pages` directory of the Filament directory, and a view in the `/pages` directory of the Filament views directory.

Page classes are all full-page [Livewire](https://livewire.laravel.com) components with a few extra utilities you can use with the panel.

## Authorization

You can prevent pages from appearing in the menu by overriding the `canAccess()` method in your Page class. This is useful if you want to control which users can see the page in the navigation, and also which users can visit the page directly:

```php
public static function canAccess(): bool
{
    return auth()->user()->canManageSettings();
}
```

## Adding actions to pages

Actions are buttons that can perform tasks on the page, or visit a URL. You can read more about their capabilities [here](../actions).

Since all pages are Livewire components, you can [add actions](../actions/adding-an-action-to-a-livewire-component#adding-the-action) anywhere. Pages already have the `InteractsWithActions` trait, `HasActions` interface, and `<x-filament-actions::modals />` Blade component all set up for you.

### Header actions

You can also easily add actions to the header of any page, including [resource pages](resources/getting-started). You don't need to worry about adding anything to the Blade template, we handle that for you. Just return your actions from the `getHeaderActions()` method of the page class:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

protected function getHeaderActions(): array
{
    return [
        Action::make('edit')
            ->url(route('posts.edit', ['post' => $this->post])),
        Action::make('delete')
            ->requiresConfirmation()
            ->action(fn () => $this->post->delete()),
    ];
}
```

### Opening an action modal when a page loads

You can also open an action when a page loads by setting the `$defaultAction` property to the name of the action you want to open:

```php
use Filament\Actions\Action;

public $defaultAction = 'onboarding';

public function onboardingAction(): Action
{
    return Action::make('onboarding')
        ->modalHeading('Welcome')
        ->visible(fn (): bool => ! auth()->user()->isOnBoarded());
}
```

You can also pass an array of arguments to the default action using the `$defaultActionArguments` property:

```php
public $defaultActionArguments = ['step' => 2];
```

Alternatively, you can open an action modal when a page loads by specifying the `action` as a query string parameter to the page:

```
/admin/products/edit/932510?action=onboarding
```

### Refreshing form data

If you're using actions on an [Edit](resources/editing-records) or [View](resources/viewing-records) resource page, you can refresh data within the main form using the `refreshFormData()` method:

```php
use App\Models\Post;
use Filament\Actions\Action;

Action::make('approve')
    ->action(function (Post $record) {
        $record->approve();

        $this->refreshFormData([
            'status',
        ]);
    })
```

This method accepts an array of model attributes that you wish to refresh in the form.

## Adding widgets to pages

Filament allows you to display [widgets](dashboard) inside pages, below the header and above the footer.

To add a widget to a page, use the `getHeaderWidgets()` or `getFooterWidgets()` methods:

```php
use App\Filament\Widgets\StatsOverviewWidget;

protected function getHeaderWidgets(): array
{
    return [
        StatsOverviewWidget::class
    ];
}
```

`getHeaderWidgets()` returns an array of widgets to display above the page content, whereas `getFooterWidgets()` are displayed below.

If you'd like to learn how to build and customize widgets, check out the [Dashboard](dashboard) documentation section.

### Customizing the widgets' grid

You may change how many grid columns are used to display widgets.

You may override the `getHeaderWidgetsColumns()` or `getFooterWidgetsColumns()` methods to return a number of grid columns to use:

```php
public function getHeaderWidgetsColumns(): int | array
{
    return 3;
}
```

#### Responsive widgets grid

You may wish to change the number of widget grid columns based on the responsive [breakpoint](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design#overview) of the browser. You can do this using an array that contains the number of columns that should be used at each breakpoint:

```php
public function getHeaderWidgetsColumns(): int | array
{
    return [
        'md' => 4,
        'xl' => 5,
    ];
}
```

This pairs well with [responsive widget widths](dashboard#responsive-widget-widths).

#### Passing data to widgets from the page

You may pass data to widgets from the page using the `getWidgetsData()` method:

```php
public function getWidgetData(): array
{
    return [
        'stats' => [
            'total' => 100,
        ],
    ];
}
```

Now, you can define a corresponding public `$stats` array property on the widget class, which will be automatically filled:

```php
public $stats = [];
```

### Passing properties to widgets on pages

When registering a widget on a page, you can use the `make()` method to pass an array of [Livewire properties](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/properties) to it:

```php
use App\Filament\Widgets\StatsOverviewWidget;

protected function getHeaderWidgets(): array
{
    return [
        StatsOverviewWidget::make([
            'status' => 'active',
        ]),
    ];
}
```

This array of properties gets mapped to [public Livewire properties](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/properties) on the widget class:

```php
use Filament\Widgets\Widget;

class StatsOverviewWidget extends Widget
{
    public string $status;

    // ...
}
```

Now, you can access the `status` in the widget class using `$this->status`.

## Customizing the page title

By default, Filament will automatically generate a title for your page based on its name. You may override this by defining a `$title` property on your page class:

```php
protected static ?string $title = 'Custom Page Title';
```

Alternatively, you may return a string from the `getTitle()` method:

```php
use Illuminate\Contracts\Support\Htmlable;

public function getTitle(): string | Htmlable
{
    return __('Custom Page Title');
}
```

## Customizing the page navigation label

By default, Filament will use the page's [title](#customizing-the-page-title) as its [navigation](navigation) item label. You may override this by defining a `$navigationLabel` property on your page class:

```php
protected static ?string $navigationLabel = 'Custom Navigation Label';
```

Alternatively, you may return a string from the `getNavigationLabel()` method:

```php
public static function getNavigationLabel(): string
{
    return __('Custom Navigation Label');
}
```

## Customizing the page URL

By default, Filament will automatically generate a URL (slug) for your page based on its name. You may override this by defining a `$slug` property on your page class:

```php
protected static ?string $slug = 'custom-url-slug';
```

## Customizing the page heading

By default, Filament will use the page's [title](#customizing-the-page-title) as its heading. You may override this by defining a `$heading` property on your page class:

```php
protected ?string $heading = 'Custom Page Heading';
```

Alternatively, you may return a string from the `getHeading()` method:

```php
public function getHeading(): string
{
    return __('Custom Page Heading');
}
```

### Adding a page subheading

You may also add a subheading to your page by defining a `$subheading` property on your page class:

```php
protected ?string $subheading = 'Custom Page Subheading';
```

Alternatively, you may return a string from the `getSubheading()` method:

```php
public function getSubheading(): ?string
{
    return __('Custom Page Subheading');
}
```

## Replacing the page header with a custom view

You may replace the default [heading](#customizing-the-page-heading), [subheading](#adding-a-page-subheading) and [actions](#header-actions) with a custom header view for any page. You may return it from the `getHeader()` method:

```php
use Illuminate\Contracts\View\View;

public function getHeader(): ?View
{
    return view('filament.settings.custom-header');
}
```

This example assumes you have a Blade view at `resources/views/filament/settings/custom-header.blade.php`.

## Rendering a custom view in the footer of the page

You may also add a footer to any page, below its content. You may return it from the `getFooter()` method:

```php
use Illuminate\Contracts\View\View;

public function getFooter(): ?View
{
    return view('filament.settings.custom-footer');
}
```

This example assumes you have a Blade view at `resources/views/filament/settings/custom-footer.blade.php`.

## Customizing the maximum content width

By default, Filament will restrict the width of the content on the page, so it doesn't become too wide on large screens. To change this, you may override the `getMaxContentWidth()` method. Options correspond to [Tailwind's max-width scale](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/max-width). The options are `ExtraSmall`, `Small`, `Medium`, `Large`, `ExtraLarge`, `TwoExtraLarge`, `ThreeExtraLarge`, `FourExtraLarge`, `FiveExtraLarge`, `SixExtraLarge`, `SevenExtraLarge`, `Full`, `MinContent`, `MaxContent`, `FitContent`,  `Prose`, `ScreenSmall`, `ScreenMedium`, `ScreenLarge`, `ScreenExtraLarge` and `ScreenTwoExtraLarge`. The default is `SevenExtraLarge`:

```php
use Filament\Support\Enums\MaxWidth;

public function getMaxContentWidth(): MaxWidth
{
    return MaxWidth::Full;
}
```

## Generating URLs to pages

Filament provides `getUrl()` static method on page classes to generate URLs to them. Traditionally, you would need to construct the URL by hand or by using Laravel's `route()` helper, but these methods depend on knowledge of the page's slug or route naming conventions.

The `getUrl()` method, without any arguments, will generate a URL:

```php
use App\Filament\Pages\Settings;

Settings::getUrl(); // /admin/settings
```

If your page uses URL / query parameters, you should use the argument:

```php
use App\Filament\Pages\Settings;

Settings::getUrl(['section' => 'notifications']); // /admin/settings?section=notifications
```

### Generating URLs to pages in other panels

If you have multiple panels in your app, `getUrl()` will generate a URL within the current panel. You can also indicate which panel the page is associated with, by passing the panel ID to the `panel` argument:

```php
use App\Filament\Pages\Settings;

Settings::getUrl(panel: 'marketing');
```

## Adding sub-navigation between pages

You may want to add a common sub-navigation to multiple pages, to allow users to quickly navigate between them. You can do this by defining a [cluster](clusters). Clusters can also contain [resources](resources), and you can switch between multiple pages or resources within a cluster.

## Adding extra attributes to the body tag of a page

You may wish to add extra attributes to the `<body>` tag of a page. To do this, you can set an array of attributes in `$extraBodyAttributes`:

```php
protected array $extraBodyAttributes = [];
```

Or, you can return an array of attributes and their values from the `getExtraBodyAttributes()` method:

```php
public function getExtraBodyAttributes(): array
{
    return [
        'class' => 'settings-page',
    ];
}
```

# Documentation for panels. File: 05-dashboard.md
---
title: Dashboard
---

## Overview

Filament allows you to build dynamic dashboards, comprised of "widgets", very easily.

The following document will explain how to use these widgets to assemble a dashboard using the panel.

## Available widgets

Filament ships with these widgets:

- [Stats overview](../widgets/stats-overview) widgets display any data, often numeric data, as stats in a row.
- [Chart](../widgets/charts) widgets display numeric data in a visual chart.
- [Table](#table-widgets) widgets which display a [table](../tables/getting-started) on your dashboard.

You may also [create your own custom widgets](#custom-widgets) which can then have a consistent design with Filament's prebuilt widgets.

## Sorting widgets

Each widget class contains a `$sort` property that may be used to change its order on the page, relative to other widgets:

```php
protected static ?int $sort = 2;
```

## Customizing widget width

You may customize the width of a widget using the `$columnSpan` property. You may use a number between 1 and 12 to indicate how many columns the widget should span, or `full` to make it occupy the full width of the page:

```php
protected int | string | array $columnSpan = 'full';
```

### Responsive widget widths

You may wish to change the widget width based on the responsive [breakpoint](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design#overview) of the browser. You can do this using an array that contains the number of columns that the widget should occupy at each breakpoint:

```php
protected int | string | array $columnSpan = [
    'md' => 2,
    'xl' => 3,
];
```

This is especially useful when using a [responsive widgets grid](#responsive-widgets-grid).

## Customizing the widgets' grid

You may change how many grid columns are used to display widgets.

Firstly, you must [replace the original Dashboard page](#customizing-the-dashboard-page).

Now, in your new `app/Filament/Pages/Dashboard.php` file, you may override the `getColumns()` method to return a number of grid columns to use:

```php
public function getColumns(): int | string | array
{
    return 2;
}
```

### Responsive widgets grid

You may wish to change the number of widget grid columns based on the responsive [breakpoint](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design#overview) of the browser. You can do this using an array that contains the number of columns that should be used at each breakpoint:

```php
public function getColumns(): int | string | array
{
    return [
        'md' => 4,
        'xl' => 5,
    ];
}
```

This pairs well with [responsive widget widths](#responsive-widget-widths).

## Conditionally hiding widgets

You may override the static `canView()` method on widgets to conditionally hide them:

```php
public static function canView(): bool
{
    return auth()->user()->isAdmin();
}
```

## Table widgets

You may easily add tables to your dashboard. Start by creating a widget with the command:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-widget LatestOrders --table
```

You may now [customize the table](../tables/getting-started) by editing the widget file.

## Custom widgets

To get started building a `BlogPostsOverview` widget:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-widget BlogPostsOverview
```

This command will create two files - a widget class in the `/Widgets` directory of the Filament directory, and a view in the `/widgets` directory of the Filament views directory.

## Filtering widget data

You may add a form to the dashboard that allows the user to filter the data displayed across all widgets. When the filters are updated, the widgets will be reloaded with the new data.

Firstly, you must [replace the original Dashboard page](#customizing-the-dashboard-page).

Now, in your new `app/Filament/Pages/Dashboard.php` file, you may add the `HasFiltersForm` trait, and add the `filtersForm()` method to return form components:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\DatePicker;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Section;
use Filament\Forms\Form;
use Filament\Pages\Dashboard as BaseDashboard;
use Filament\Pages\Dashboard\Concerns\HasFiltersForm;

class Dashboard extends BaseDashboard
{
    use HasFiltersForm;

    public function filtersForm(Form $form): Form
    {
        return $form
            ->schema([
                Section::make()
                    ->schema([
                        DatePicker::make('startDate'),
                        DatePicker::make('endDate'),
                        // ...
                    ])
                    ->columns(3),
            ]);
    }
}
```

In widget classes that require data from the filters, you need to add the `InteractsWithPageFilters` trait, which will allow you to use the `$this->filters` property to access the raw data from the filters form:

```php
use App\Models\BlogPost;
use Carbon\CarbonImmutable;
use Filament\Widgets\StatsOverviewWidget;
use Filament\Widgets\Concerns\InteractsWithPageFilters;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

class BlogPostsOverview extends StatsOverviewWidget
{
    use InteractsWithPageFilters;

    public function getStats(): array
    {
        $startDate = $this->filters['startDate'] ?? null;
        $endDate = $this->filters['endDate'] ?? null;

        return [
            StatsOverviewWidget\Stat::make(
                label: 'Total posts',
                value: BlogPost::query()
                    ->when($startDate, fn (Builder $query) => $query->whereDate('created_at', '>=', $startDate))
                    ->when($endDate, fn (Builder $query) => $query->whereDate('created_at', '<=', $endDate))
                    ->count(),
            ),
            // ...
        ];
    }
}
```

The `$this->filters` array will always reflect the current form data. Please note that this data is not validated, as it is available live and not intended to be used for anything other than querying the database. You must ensure that the data is valid before using it. In this example, we check if the start date is set before using it in the query.

### Filtering widget data using an action modal

Alternatively, you can swap out the filters form for an action modal, that can be opened by clicking a button in the header of the page. There are many benefits to using this approach:

- The filters form is not always visible, which allows you to use the full height of the page for widgets.
- The filters do not update the widgets until the user clicks the "Apply" button, which means that the widgets are not reloaded until the user is ready. This can improve performance if the widgets are expensive to load.
- Validation can be performed on the filters form, which means that the widgets can rely on the fact that the data is valid - the user cannot submit the form until it is. Canceling the modal will discard the user's changes.

To use an action modal instead of a filters form, you can use the `HasFiltersAction` trait instead of `HasFiltersForm`. Then, register the `FilterAction` class as an action in `getHeaderActions()`:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\DatePicker;
use Filament\Forms\Form;
use Filament\Pages\Dashboard as BaseDashboard;
use Filament\Pages\Dashboard\Actions\FilterAction;
use Filament\Pages\Dashboard\Concerns\HasFiltersAction;

class Dashboard extends BaseDashboard
{
    use HasFiltersAction;
    
    protected function getHeaderActions(): array
    {
        return [
            FilterAction::make()
                ->form([
                    DatePicker::make('startDate'),
                    DatePicker::make('endDate'),
                    // ...
                ]),
        ];
    }
}
```

Handling data from the filter action is the same as handling data from the filters header form, except that the data is validated before being passed to the widget. The `InteractsWithPageFilters` trait still applies.

## Disabling the default widgets

By default, two widgets are displayed on the dashboard. These widgets can be disabled by updating the `widgets()` array of the [configuration](configuration):

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->widgets([]);
}
```

## Customizing the dashboard page

If you want to customize the dashboard class, for example, to [change the number of widget columns](#customizing-widget-width), create a new file at `app/Filament/Pages/Dashboard.php`:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Filament\Pages;

class Dashboard extends \Filament\Pages\Dashboard
{
    // ...
}
```

Finally, remove the original `Dashboard` class from [configuration file](configuration):

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->pages([]);
}
```

### Creating multiple dashboards

If you want to create multiple dashboards, you can do so by repeating [the process described above](#customizing-the-dashboard-page). Creating new pages that extend the `Dashboard` class will allow you to create as many dashboards as you need.

You will also need to define the URL path to the extra dashboard, otherwise it will be at `/`:

```php
protected static string $routePath = 'finance';
```

You may also customize the title of the dashboard by overriding the `$title` property:

```php
protected static ?string $title = 'Finance dashboard';
```

The primary dashboard shown to a user is the first one they have access to (controlled by [`canAccess()` method](pages#authorization)), according to the defined navigation sort order.

The default sort order for dashboards is `-2`. You can control the sort order of custom dashboards with `$navigationSort`:

```php
protected static ?int $navigationSort = 15;
```

# Documentation for panels. File: 06-navigation.md
---
title: Navigation
---
import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"

## Overview

By default, Filament will register navigation items for each of your [resources](resources/getting-started), [custom pages](pages), and [clusters](clusters). These classes contain static properties and methods that you can override, to configure that navigation item.

If you're looking to add a second layer of navigation to your app, you can use [clusters](clusters). These are useful for grouping resources and pages together.

## Customizing a navigation item's label

By default, the navigation label is generated from the resource or page's name. You may customize this using the `$navigationLabel` property:

```php
protected static ?string $navigationLabel = 'Custom Navigation Label';
```

Alternatively, you may override the `getNavigationLabel()` method:

```php
public static function getNavigationLabel(): string
{
    return 'Custom Navigation Label';
}
```

## Customizing a navigation item's icon

To customize a navigation item's [icon](https://blade-ui-kit.com/blade-icons?set=1#search), you may override the `$navigationIcon` property on the [resource](resources/getting-started) or [page](pages) class:

```php
protected static ?string $navigationIcon = 'heroicon-o-document-text';
```

<AutoScreenshot name="panels/navigation/change-icon" alt="Changed navigation item icon" version="3.x" />

If you set `$navigationIcon = null` on all items within the same navigation group, those items will be joined with a vertical bar below the group label.

### Switching navigation item icon when it is active

You may assign a navigation [icon](https://blade-ui-kit.com/blade-icons?set=1#search) which will only be used for active items using the `$activeNavigationIcon` property:

```php
protected static ?string $activeNavigationIcon = 'heroicon-o-document-text';
```

<AutoScreenshot name="panels/navigation/active-icon" alt="Different navigation item icon when active" version="3.x" />

## Sorting navigation items

By default, navigation items are sorted alphabetically. You may customize this using the `$navigationSort` property:

```php
protected static ?int $navigationSort = 3;
```

Now, navigation items with a lower sort value will appear before those with a higher sort value - the order is ascending.

<AutoScreenshot name="panels/navigation/sort-items" alt="Sort navigation items" version="3.x" />

## Adding a badge to a navigation item

To add a badge next to the navigation item, you can use the `getNavigationBadge()` method and return the content of the badge:

```php
public static function getNavigationBadge(): ?string
{
    return static::getModel()::count();
}
```

<AutoScreenshot name="panels/navigation/badge" alt="Navigation item with badge" version="3.x" />

If a badge value is returned by `getNavigationBadge()`, it will display using the primary color by default. To style the badge contextually, return either `danger`, `gray`, `info`, `primary`, `success` or `warning` from the `getNavigationBadgeColor()` method:

```php
public static function getNavigationBadgeColor(): ?string
{
    return static::getModel()::count() > 10 ? 'warning' : 'primary';
}
```

<AutoScreenshot name="panels/navigation/badge-color" alt="Navigation item with badge color" version="3.x" />

A custom tooltip for the navigation badge can be set in `$navigationBadgeTooltip`:

```php
protected static ?string $navigationBadgeTooltip = 'The number of users';
```

Or it can be returned from `getNavigationBadgeTooltip()`:

```php
public static function getNavigationBadgeTooltip(): ?string
{
    return 'The number of users';
}
```

<AutoScreenshot name="panels/navigation/badge-tooltip" alt="Navigation item with badge tooltip" version="3.x" />

## Grouping navigation items

You may group navigation items by specifying a `$navigationGroup` property on a [resource](resources/getting-started) and [custom page](pages):

```php
protected static ?string $navigationGroup = 'Settings';
```

<AutoScreenshot name="panels/navigation/group" alt="Grouped navigation items" version="3.x" />

All items in the same navigation group will be displayed together under the same group label, "Settings" in this case. Ungrouped items will remain at the start of the navigation.

### Grouping navigation items under other items

You may group navigation items as children of other items, by passing the label of the parent item as the `$navigationParentItem`:

```php
protected static ?string $navigationParentItem = 'Notifications';

protected static ?string $navigationGroup = 'Settings';
```

You may also use the `getNavigationParentItem()` method to set a dynamic parent item label:

```php
public static function getNavigationParentItem(): ?string
{
    return __('filament/navigation.groups.settings.items.notifications');
}
```

As seen above, if the parent item has a navigation group, that navigation group must also be defined, so the correct parent item can be identified.

> If you're reaching for a third level of navigation like this, you should consider using [clusters](clusters) instead, which are a logical grouping of resources and custom pages, which can share their own separate navigation.

### Customizing navigation groups

You may customize navigation groups by calling `navigationGroups()` in the [configuration](configuration), and passing `NavigationGroup` objects in order:

```php
use Filament\Navigation\NavigationGroup;
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->navigationGroups([
            NavigationGroup::make()
                 ->label('Shop')
                 ->icon('heroicon-o-shopping-cart'),
            NavigationGroup::make()
                ->label('Blog')
                ->icon('heroicon-o-pencil'),
            NavigationGroup::make()
                ->label(fn (): string => __('navigation.settings'))
                ->icon('heroicon-o-cog-6-tooth')
                ->collapsed(),
        ]);
}
```

In this example, we pass in a custom `icon()` for the groups, and make one `collapsed()` by default.

#### Ordering navigation groups

By using `navigationGroups()`, you are defining a new order for the navigation groups. If you just want to reorder the groups and not define an entire `NavigationGroup` object, you may just pass the labels of the groups in the new order:

```php
$panel
    ->navigationGroups([
        'Shop',
        'Blog',
        'Settings',
    ])
```

#### Making navigation groups not collapsible

By default, navigation groups are collapsible.

<AutoScreenshot name="panels/navigation/group-collapsible" alt="Collapsible navigation groups" version="3.x" />

You may disable this behavior by calling `collapsible(false)` on the `NavigationGroup` object:

```php
use Filament\Navigation\NavigationGroup;

NavigationGroup::make()
    ->label('Settings')
    ->icon('heroicon-o-cog-6-tooth')
    ->collapsible(false);
```

<AutoScreenshot name="panels/navigation/group-not-collapsible" alt="Not collapsible navigation groups" version="3.x" />

Or, you can do it globally for all groups in the [configuration](configuration):

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->collapsibleNavigationGroups(false);
}
```

#### Adding extra HTML attributes to navigation groups

You can pass extra HTML attributes to the navigation group, which will be merged onto the outer DOM element. Pass an array of attributes to the `extraSidebarAttributes()` or `extraTopbarAttributes()` method, where the key is the attribute name and the value is the attribute value:

```php
NavigationGroup::make()
    ->extraSidebarAttributes(['class' => 'featured-sidebar-group']),
    ->extraTopbarAttributes(['class' => 'featured-topbar-group']),
```

The `extraSidebarAttributes()` will be applied to navigation group elements contained in the sidebar, and the `extraTopbarAttributes()` will only be applied to topbar navigation group dropdowns when using [top navigation](#using-top-navigation).

## Collapsible sidebar on desktop

To make the sidebar collapsible on desktop as well as mobile, you can use the [configuration](configuration):

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->sidebarCollapsibleOnDesktop();
}
```

<AutoScreenshot name="panels/navigation/sidebar-collapsible-on-desktop" alt="Collapsible sidebar on desktop" version="3.x" />

By default, when you collapse the sidebar on desktop, the navigation icons still show. You can fully collapse the sidebar using the `sidebarFullyCollapsibleOnDesktop()` method:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->sidebarFullyCollapsibleOnDesktop();
}
```

<AutoScreenshot name="panels/navigation/sidebar-fully-collapsible-on-desktop" alt="Fully collapsible sidebar on desktop" version="3.x" />

### Navigation groups in a collapsible sidebar on desktop

> This section only applies to `sidebarCollapsibleOnDesktop()`, not `sidebarFullyCollapsibleOnDesktop()`, since the fully collapsible UI just hides the entire sidebar instead of changing its design.

When using a collapsible sidebar on desktop, you will also often be using [navigation groups](#grouping-navigation-items). By default, the labels of each navigation group will be hidden when the sidebar is collapsed, since there is no space to display them. Even if the navigation group itself is [collapsible](#making-navigation-groups-not-collapsible), all items will still be visible in the collapsed sidebar, since there is no group label to click on to expand the group.

These issues can be solved, to achieve a very minimal sidebar design, by [passing an `icon()`](#customizing-navigation-groups) to the navigation group objects. When an icon is defined, the icon will be displayed in the collapsed sidebar instead of the items at all times. When the icon is clicked, a dropdown will open to the side of the icon, revealing the items in the group.

When passing an icon to a navigation group, even if the items also have icons, the expanded sidebar UI will not show the item icons. This is to keep the navigation hierarchy clear, and the design minimal. However, the icons for the items will be shown in the collapsed sidebar's dropdowns though, since the hierarchy is already clear from the fact that the dropdown is open.

## Registering custom navigation items

To register new navigation items, you can use the [configuration](configuration):

```php
use Filament\Navigation\NavigationItem;
use Filament\Pages\Dashboard;
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->navigationItems([
            NavigationItem::make('Analytics')
                ->url('https://filament.pirsch.io', shouldOpenInNewTab: true)
                ->icon('heroicon-o-presentation-chart-line')
                ->group('Reports')
                ->sort(3),
            NavigationItem::make('dashboard')
                ->label(fn (): string => __('filament-panels::pages/dashboard.title'))
                ->url(fn (): string => Dashboard::getUrl())
                ->isActiveWhen(fn () => request()->routeIs('filament.admin.pages.dashboard')),
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

## Conditionally hiding navigation items

You can also conditionally hide a navigation item by using the `visible()` or `hidden()` methods, passing in a condition to check:

```php
use Filament\Navigation\NavigationItem;

NavigationItem::make('Analytics')
    ->visible(fn(): bool => auth()->user()->can('view-analytics'))
    // or
    ->hidden(fn(): bool => ! auth()->user()->can('view-analytics')),
```

## Disabling resource or page navigation items

To prevent resources or pages from showing up in navigation, you may use:

```php
protected static bool $shouldRegisterNavigation = false;
```

Or, you may override the `shouldRegisterNavigation()` method:

```php
public static function shouldRegisterNavigation(): bool
{
    return false;
}
```

Please note that these methods do not control direct access to the resource or page. They only control whether the resource or page will show up in the navigation. If you want to also control access, then you should use [resource authorization](resources/getting-started#authorization) or [page authorization](pages#authorization).

## Using top navigation

By default, Filament will use a sidebar navigation. You may use a top navigation instead by using the [configuration](configuration):

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->topNavigation();
}
```

<AutoScreenshot name="panels/navigation/top-navigation" alt="Top navigation" version="3.x" />

## Customizing the width of the sidebar

You can customize the width of the sidebar by passing it to the `sidebarWidth()` method in the [configuration](configuration):

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->sidebarWidth('40rem');
}
```

Additionally, if you are using the `sidebarCollapsibleOnDesktop()` method, you can customize width of the collapsed icons by using the `collapsedSidebarWidth()` method in the [configuration](configuration):

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->sidebarCollapsibleOnDesktop()
        ->collapsedSidebarWidth('9rem');
}
```

## Advanced navigation customization

The `navigation()` method can be called from the [configuration](configuration). It allows you to build a custom navigation that overrides Filament's automatically generated items. This API is designed to give you complete control over the navigation.

### Registering custom navigation items

To register navigation items, call the `items()` method:

```php
use App\Filament\Pages\Settings;
use App\Filament\Resources\UserResource;
use Filament\Navigation\NavigationBuilder;
use Filament\Navigation\NavigationItem;
use Filament\Pages\Dashboard;
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->navigation(function (NavigationBuilder $builder): NavigationBuilder {
            return $builder->items([
                NavigationItem::make('Dashboard')
                    ->icon('heroicon-o-home')
                    ->isActiveWhen(fn (): bool => request()->routeIs('filament.admin.pages.dashboard'))
                    ->url(fn (): string => Dashboard::getUrl()),
                ...UserResource::getNavigationItems(),
                ...Settings::getNavigationItems(),
            ]);
        });
}
```

<AutoScreenshot name="panels/navigation/custom-items" alt="Custom navigation items" version="3.x" />

### Registering custom navigation groups

If you want to register groups, you can call the `groups()` method:

```php
use App\Filament\Pages\HomePageSettings;
use App\Filament\Resources\CategoryResource;
use App\Filament\Resources\PageResource;
use Filament\Navigation\NavigationBuilder;
use Filament\Navigation\NavigationGroup;
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->navigation(function (NavigationBuilder $builder): NavigationBuilder {
            return $builder->groups([
                NavigationGroup::make('Website')
                    ->items([
                        ...PageResource::getNavigationItems(),
                        ...CategoryResource::getNavigationItems(),
                        ...HomePageSettings::getNavigationItems(),
                    ]),
            ]);
        });
}
```

### Disabling navigation

You may disable navigation entirely by passing `false` to the `navigation()` method:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->navigation(false);
}
```

<AutoScreenshot name="panels/navigation/disabled-navigation" alt="Disabled navigation sidebar" version="3.x" />

### Disabling the topbar

You may disable topbar entirely by passing `false` to the `topbar()` method:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->topbar(false);
}
```

## Customizing the user menu

The user menu is featured in the top right corner of the admin layout. It's fully customizable.

To register new items to the user menu, you can use the [configuration](configuration):

```php
use App\Filament\Pages\Settings;
use Filament\Navigation\MenuItem;
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->userMenuItems([
            MenuItem::make()
                ->label('Settings')
                ->url(fn (): string => Settings::getUrl())
                ->icon('heroicon-o-cog-6-tooth'),
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

<AutoScreenshot name="panels/navigation/user-menu" alt="User menu with custom menu item" version="3.x" />

### Customizing the profile link

To customize the user profile link at the start of the user menu, register a new item with the `profile` array key:

```php
use Filament\Navigation\MenuItem;
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->userMenuItems([
            'profile' => MenuItem::make()->label('Edit profile'),
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

For more information on creating a profile page, check out the [authentication features documentation](users#authentication-features).

### Customizing the logout link

To customize the user logout link at the end of the user menu, register a new item with the `logout` array key:

```php
use Filament\Navigation\MenuItem;
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->userMenuItems([
            'logout' => MenuItem::make()->label('Log out'),
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

### Conditionally hiding user menu items

You can also conditionally hide a user menu item by using the `visible()` or `hidden()` methods, passing in a condition to check. Passing a function will defer condition evaluation until the menu is actually being rendered:

```php
use App\Models\Payment;
use Filament\Navigation\MenuItem;

MenuItem::make()
    ->label('Payments')
    ->visible(fn (): bool => auth()->user()->can('viewAny', Payment::class))
    // or
    ->hidden(fn (): bool => ! auth()->user()->can('viewAny', Payment::class))
```

### Sending a `POST` HTTP request from a user menu item

You can send a `POST` HTTP request from a user menu item by passing a URL to the `postAction()` method:

```php
use Filament\Navigation\MenuItem;

MenuItem::make()
    ->label('Lock session')
    ->postAction(fn (): string => route('lock-session'))
```

## Disabling breadcrumbs

The default layout will show breadcrumbs to indicate the location of the current page within the hierarchy of the app.

You may disable breadcrumbs in your [configuration](configuration):

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->breadcrumbs(false);
}
```

# Documentation for panels. File: 07-notifications.md
---
title: Notifications
---

## Overview

The Panel Builder uses the [Notifications](../notifications/sending-notifications) package to send messages to users. Please read the [documentation](../notifications/sending-notifications) to discover how to send notifications easily.

If you'd like to receive [database notifications](../notifications/database-notifications), you can enable them in the [configuration](configuration):

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->databaseNotifications();
}
```

You may also control database notification [polling](../notifications/database-notifications#polling-for-new-database-notifications):

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->databaseNotifications()
        ->databaseNotificationsPolling('30s');
}
```

## Setting up websockets in a panel

The Panel Builder comes with a level of inbuilt support for real-time broadcast and database notifications. However there are a number of areas you will need to install and configure to wire everything up and get it working.

1. If you haven't already, read up on [broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting) in the Laravel documentation.
2. Install and configure broadcasting to use a [server-side websockets integration](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting#server-side-installation) like Pusher.
3. If you haven't already, you will need to publish the Filament package configuration:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=filament-config
```

4. Edit the configuration at `config/filament.php` and uncomment the `broadcasting.echo` section - ensuring the settings are correctly configured according to your broadcasting installation.
5. Ensure the [relevant `VITE_*` entries](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting#client-pusher-channels) exist in your `.env` file.
6. Clear relevant caches with `php artisan route:clear` and `php artisan config:clear` to ensure your new configuration takes effect.

Your panel should now be connecting to your broadcasting service. For example, if you log into the Pusher debug console you should see an incoming connection each time you load a page.

To send a real-time notification, see the [broadcast notifications documentation](../notifications/broadcast-notifications).

# Documentation for panels. File: 08-users.md
---
title: Users
---

## Overview

By default, all `App\Models\User`s can access Filament locally. To allow them to access Filament in production, you must take a few extra steps to ensure that only the correct users have access to the app.

## Authorizing access to the panel

To set up your `App\Models\User` to access Filament in non-local environments, you must implement the `FilamentUser` contract:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Filament\Models\Contracts\FilamentUser;
use Filament\Panel;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;

class User extends Authenticatable implements FilamentUser
{
    // ...

    public function canAccessPanel(Panel $panel): bool
    {
        return str_ends_with($this->email, '@yourdomain.com') && $this->hasVerifiedEmail();
    }
}
```

The `canAccessPanel()` method returns `true` or `false` depending on whether the user is allowed to access the `$panel`. In this example, we check if the user's email ends with `@yourdomain.com` and if they have verified their email address.

Since you have access to the current `$panel`, you can write conditional checks for separate panels. For example, only restricting access to the admin panel while allowing all users to access the other panels of your app:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Filament\Models\Contracts\FilamentUser;
use Filament\Panel;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;

class User extends Authenticatable implements FilamentUser
{
    // ...

    public function canAccessPanel(Panel $panel): bool
    {
        if ($panel->getId() === 'admin') {
            return str_ends_with($this->email, '@yourdomain.com') && $this->hasVerifiedEmail();
        }

        return true;
    }
}
```

## Authorizing access to Resources

See the [Authorization](resources/getting-started#authorization) section in the Resource documentation for controlling access to Resource pages and their data records.

## Setting up user avatars

Out of the box, Filament uses [ui-avatars.com](https://ui-avatars.com) to generate avatars based on a user's name. However, if your user model has an `avatar_url` attribute, that will be used instead. To customize how Filament gets a user's avatar URL, you can implement the `HasAvatar` contract:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Filament\Models\Contracts\FilamentUser;
use Filament\Models\Contracts\HasAvatar;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;

class User extends Authenticatable implements FilamentUser, HasAvatar
{
    // ...

    public function getFilamentAvatarUrl(): ?string
    {
        return $this->avatar_url;
    }
}
```

The `getFilamentAvatarUrl()` method is used to retrieve the avatar of the current user. If `null` is returned from this method, Filament will fall back to [ui-avatars.com](https://ui-avatars.com).

### Using a different avatar provider

You can easily swap out [ui-avatars.com](https://ui-avatars.com) for a different service, by creating a new avatar provider.

In this example, we create a new file at `app/Filament/AvatarProviders/BoringAvatarsProvider.php` for [boringavatars.com](https://boringavatars.com). The `get()` method accepts a user model instance and returns an avatar URL for that user:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Filament\AvatarProviders;

use Filament\AvatarProviders\Contracts;
use Filament\Facades\Filament;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Auth\Authenticatable;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class BoringAvatarsProvider implements Contracts\AvatarProvider
{
    public function get(Model | Authenticatable $record): string
    {
        $name = str(Filament::getNameForDefaultAvatar($record))
            ->trim()
            ->explode(' ')
            ->map(fn (string $segment): string => filled($segment) ? mb_substr($segment, 0, 1) : '')
            ->join(' ');

        return 'https://source.boringavatars.com/beam/120/' . urlencode($name);
    }
}
```

Now, register this new avatar provider in the [configuration](configuration):

```php
use App\Filament\AvatarProviders\BoringAvatarsProvider;
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->defaultAvatarProvider(BoringAvatarsProvider::class);
}
```

## Configuring the user's name attribute

By default, Filament will use the `name` attribute of the user to display their name in the app. To change this, you can implement the `HasName` contract:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Filament\Models\Contracts\FilamentUser;
use Filament\Models\Contracts\HasName;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;

class User extends Authenticatable implements FilamentUser, HasName
{
    // ...

    public function getFilamentName(): string
    {
        return "{$this->first_name} {$this->last_name}";
    }
}
```

The `getFilamentName()` method is used to retrieve the name of the current user.

## Authentication features

You can easily enable authentication features for a panel in the configuration file:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->login()
        ->registration()
        ->passwordReset()
        ->emailVerification()
        ->profile();
}
```

### Customizing the authentication features

If you'd like to replace these pages with your own, you can pass in any Filament page class to these methods.

Most people will be able to make their desired customizations by extending the base page class from the Filament codebase, overriding methods like `form()`, and then passing the new page class in to the configuration:

```php
use App\Filament\Pages\Auth\EditProfile;
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->profile(EditProfile::class);
}
```

In this example, we will customize the profile page. We need to create a new PHP class at `app/Filament/Pages/Auth/EditProfile.php`:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Filament\Pages\Auth;

use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Forms\Form;
use Filament\Pages\Auth\EditProfile as BaseEditProfile;

class EditProfile extends BaseEditProfile
{
    public function form(Form $form): Form
    {
        return $form
            ->schema([
                TextInput::make('username')
                    ->required()
                    ->maxLength(255),
                $this->getNameFormComponent(),
                $this->getEmailFormComponent(),
                $this->getPasswordFormComponent(),
                $this->getPasswordConfirmationFormComponent(),
            ]);
    }
}
```

This class extends the base profile page class from the Filament codebase. Other page classes you could extend include:

- `Filament\Pages\Auth\Login`
- `Filament\Pages\Auth\Register`
- `Filament\Pages\Auth\EmailVerification\EmailVerificationPrompt`
- `Filament\Pages\Auth\PasswordReset\RequestPasswordReset`
- `Filament\Pages\Auth\PasswordReset\ResetPassword`

In the `form()` method of the example, we call methods like `getNameFormComponent()` to get the default form components for the page. You can customize these components as required. For all the available customization options, see the base `EditProfile` page class in the Filament codebase - it contains all the methods that you can override to make changes.

#### Customizing an authentication field without needing to re-define the form

If you'd like to customize a field in an authentication form without needing to define a new `form()` method, you could extend the specific field method and chain your customizations:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Component;

protected function getPasswordFormComponent(): Component
{
    return parent::getPasswordFormComponent()
        ->revealable(false);
}
```

### Using a sidebar on the profile page

By default, the profile page does not use the standard page layout with a sidebar. This is so that it works with the [tenancy](tenancy) feature, otherwise it would not be accessible if the user had no tenants, since the sidebar links are routed to the current tenant.

If you aren't using [tenancy](tenancy) in your panel, and you'd like the profile page to use the standard page layout with a sidebar, you can pass the `isSimple: false` parameter to `$panel->profile()` when registering the page:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->profile(isSimple: false);
}
```

### Customizing the authentication route slugs

You can customize the URL slugs used for the authentication routes in the [configuration](configuration):

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->loginRouteSlug('login')
        ->registrationRouteSlug('register')
        ->passwordResetRoutePrefix('password-reset')
        ->passwordResetRequestRouteSlug('request')
        ->passwordResetRouteSlug('reset')
        ->emailVerificationRoutePrefix('email-verification')
        ->emailVerificationPromptRouteSlug('prompt')
        ->emailVerificationRouteSlug('verify');
}
```

### Setting the authentication guard

To set the authentication guard that Filament uses, you can pass in the guard name to the `authGuard()` [configuration](configuration) method:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->authGuard('web');
}
```

### Setting the password broker

To set the password broker that Filament uses, you can pass in the broker name to the `authPasswordBroker()` [configuration](configuration) method:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->authPasswordBroker('users');
}
```

### Disabling revealable password inputs

By default, all password inputs in authentication forms are [`revealable()`](../forms/fields/text-input#revealable-password-inputs). This allows the user can see a plain text version of the password they're typing by clicking a button. To disable this feature, you can pass `false` to the `revealablePasswords()` [configuration](configuration) method:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->revealablePasswords(false);
}
```

You could also disable this feature on a per-field basis by calling `->revealable(false)` on the field object when [extending the base page class](#customizing-an-authentication-field-without-needing-to-re-define-the-form).

## Setting up guest access to a panel

By default, Filament expects to work with authenticated users only. To allow guests to access a panel, you need to avoid using components which expect a signed-in user (such as profiles, avatars), and remove the built-in Authentication middleware:

- Remove the default `Authenticate::class` from the `authMiddleware()` array in the panel configuration.
- Remove `->login()` and any other [authentication features](#authentication-features) from the panel.
- Remove the default `AccountWidget` from the `widgets()` array, because it reads the current user's data.

### Authorizing guests in policies

When present, Filament relies on [Laravel Model Policies](https://laravel.com/docs/authorization#generating-policies) for access control. To give read-access for [guest users in a model policy](https://laravel.com/docs/authorization#guest-users), create the Policy and update the `viewAny()` and `view()` methods, changing the `User $user` param to `?User $user` so that it's optional, and `return true;`. Alternatively, you can remove those methods from the policy entirely.

# Documentation for panels. File: 09-configuration.md
---
title: Configuration
---

## Overview

By default, the configuration file is located at `app/Providers/Filament/AdminPanelProvider.php`. Keep reading to learn more about [panels](#introducing-panels) and how each has [its own configuration file](#creating-a-new-panel).

## Introducing panels

By default, when you install the package, there is one panel that has been set up for you - and it lives on `/admin`. All the [resources](resources/getting-started), [custom pages](pages), and [dashboard widgets](dashboard) you create get registered to this panel.

However, you can create as many panels as you want, and each can have its own set of resources, pages and widgets.

For example, you could build a panel where users can log in at `/app` and access their dashboard, and admins can log in at `/admin` and manage the app. The `/app` panel and the `/admin` panel have their own resources, since each group of users has different requirements. Filament allows you to do that by providing you with the ability to create multiple panels.

### The default admin panel

When you run `filament:install`, a new file is created in `app/Providers/Filament` - `AdminPanelProvider.php`. This file contains the configuration for the `/admin` panel.

When this documentation refers to the "configuration", this is the file you need to edit. It allows you to completely customize the app.

### Creating a new panel

To create a new panel, you can use the `make:filament-panel` command, passing in the unique name of the new panel:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-panel app
```

This command will create a new panel called "app". A configuration file will be created at `app/Providers/Filament/AppPanelProvider.php`. You can access this panel at `/app`, but you can [customize the path](#changing-the-path) if you don't want that.

Since this configuration file is also a [Laravel service provider](https://laravel.com/docs/providers), it needs to be registered in `bootstrap/providers.php` (Laravel 11 and above) or `config/app.php` (Laravel 10 and below). Filament will attempt to do this for you, but if you get an error while trying to access your panel then this process has probably failed.

## Changing the path

In a panel configuration file, you can change the path that the app is accessible at using the `path()` method:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->path('app');
}
```

If you want the app to be accessible without any prefix, you can set this to be an empty string:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->path('');
}
```

Make sure your `routes/web.php` file doesn't already define the `''` or `'/'` route, as it will take precedence.

## Render hooks

[Render hooks](../support/render-hooks) allow you to render Blade content at various points in the framework views. You can [register global render hooks](../support/render-hooks#registering-render-hooks) in a service provider or middleware, but it also allows you to register render hooks that are specific to a panel. To do that, you can use the `renderHook()` method on the panel configuration object. Here's an example, integrating [`wire-elements/modal`](https://github.com/wire-elements/modal) with Filament:

```php
use Filament\Panel;
use Filament\View\PanelsRenderHook;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Blade;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->renderHook(
            PanelsRenderHook::BODY_START,
            fn (): string => Blade::render('@livewire(\'livewire-ui-modal\')'),
        );
}
```

A full list of available render hooks can be found [here](../support/render-hooks#available-render-hooks).

## Setting a domain

By default, Filament will respond to requests from all domains. If you'd like to scope it to a specific domain, you can use the `domain()` method, similar to [`Route::domain()` in Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs/routing#route-group-subdomain-routing):

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->domain('admin.example.com');
}
```

## Customizing the maximum content width

By default, Filament will restrict the width of the content on the page, so it doesn't become too wide on large screens. To change this, you may use the `maxContentWidth()` method. Options correspond to [Tailwind's max-width scale](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/max-width). The options are `ExtraSmall`, `Small`, `Medium`, `Large`, `ExtraLarge`, `TwoExtraLarge`, `ThreeExtraLarge`, `FourExtraLarge`, `FiveExtraLarge`, `SixExtraLarge`, `SevenExtraLarge`, `Full`, `MinContent`, `MaxContent`, `FitContent`,  `Prose`, `ScreenSmall`, `ScreenMedium`, `ScreenLarge`, `ScreenExtraLarge` and `ScreenTwoExtraLarge`. The default is `SevenExtraLarge`:

```php
use Filament\Panel;
use Filament\Support\Enums\MaxWidth;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->maxContentWidth(MaxWidth::Full);
}
```

If you'd like to set the max content width for pages of the type `SimplePage`, like login and registration pages, you may do so using the `simplePageMaxContentWidth()` method. The default is `Large`:

```php
use Filament\Panel;
use Filament\Support\Enums\MaxWidth;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->simplePageMaxContentWidth(MaxWidth::Small);
}
```

## Lifecycle hooks

Hooks may be used to execute code during a panel's lifecycle. `bootUsing()` is a hook that gets run on every request that takes place within that panel. If you have multiple panels, only the current panel's `bootUsing()` will be run. The function gets run from middleware, after all service providers have been booted:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->bootUsing(function (Panel $panel) {
            // ...
        });
}
```

## SPA mode

SPA mode utilizes [Livewire's `wire:navigate` feature](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/navigate) to make your server-rendered panel feel like a single-page-application, with less delay between page loads and a loading bar for longer requests. To enable SPA mode on a panel, you can use the `spa()` method:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->spa();
}
```

### Disabling SPA navigation for specific URLs

By default, when enabling SPA mode, any URL that lives on the same domain as the current request will be navigated to using Livewire's [`wire:navigate`](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/navigate) feature. If you want to disable this for specific URLs, you can use the `spaUrlExceptions()` method:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\PostResource;
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->spa()
        ->spaUrlExceptions(fn (): array => [
            url('/admin'),
            PostResource::getUrl(),
        ]);
}
```

> In this example, we are using [`getUrl()`](/resources/getting-started#generating-urls-to-resource-pages) on a resource to get the URL to the resource's index page. This feature requires the panel to already be registered though, and the configuration is too early in the request lifecycle to do that. You can use a function to return the URLs instead, which will be resolved when the panel has been registered.

These URLs need to exactly match the URL that the user is navigating to, including the domain and protocol. If you'd like to use a pattern to match multiple URLs, you can use an asterisk (`*`) as a wildcard character:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->spa()
        ->spaUrlExceptions([
            '*/admin/posts/*',
        ]);
}
```

## Unsaved changes alerts

You may alert users if they attempt to navigate away from a page without saving their changes. This is applied on [Create](resources/creating-records) and [Edit](resources/editing-records) pages of a resource, as well as any open action modals. To enable this feature, you can use the `unsavedChangesAlerts()` method:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->unsavedChangesAlerts();
}
```

## Enabling database transactions

By default, Filament does not wrap operations in database transactions, and allows the user to enable this themselves when they have tested to ensure that their operations are safe to be wrapped in a transaction. However, you can enable database transactions at once for all operations by using the `databaseTransactions()` method:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->databaseTransactions();
}
```

For any actions you do not want to be wrapped in a transaction, you can use the `databaseTransaction(false)` method:

```php
CreateAction::make()
    ->databaseTransaction(false)
```

And for any pages like [Create resource](resources/creating-records) and [Edit resource](resources/editing-records), you can define the `$hasDatabaseTransactions` property to `false` on the page class:

```php
use Filament\Resources\Pages\CreateRecord;

class CreatePost extends CreateRecord
{
    protected ?bool $hasDatabaseTransactions = false;

    // ...
}
```

### Opting in to database transactions for specific actions and pages

Instead of enabling database transactions everywhere and opting out of them for specific actions and pages, you can opt in to database transactions for specific actions and pages.

For actions, you can use the `databaseTransaction()` method:

```php
CreateAction::make()
    ->databaseTransaction()
```

For pages like [Create resource](resources/creating-records) and [Edit resource](resources/editing-records), you can define the `$hasDatabaseTransactions` property to `true` on the page class:

```php
use Filament\Resources\Pages\CreateRecord;

class CreatePost extends CreateRecord
{
    protected ?bool $hasDatabaseTransactions = true;

    // ...
}
```

## Registering assets for a panel

You can register [assets](../support/assets) that will only be loaded on pages within a specific panel, and not in the rest of the app. To do that, pass an array of assets to the `assets()` method:

```php
use Filament\Panel;
use Filament\Support\Assets\Css;
use Filament\Support\Assets\Js;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->assets([
            Css::make('custom-stylesheet', resource_path('css/custom.css')),
            Js::make('custom-script', resource_path('js/custom.js')),
        ]);
}
```

Before these [assets](../support/assets) can be used, you'll need to run `php artisan filament:assets`.

## Applying middleware

You can apply extra middleware to all routes by passing an array of middleware classes to the `middleware()` method in the configuration:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->middleware([
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

By default, middleware will be run when the page is first loaded, but not on subsequent Livewire AJAX requests. If you want to run middleware on every request, you can make it persistent by passing `true` as the second argument to the `middleware()` method:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->middleware([
            // ...
        ], isPersistent: true);
}
```

### Applying middleware to authenticated routes

You can apply middleware to all authenticated routes by passing an array of middleware classes to the `authMiddleware()` method in the configuration:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->authMiddleware([
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

By default, middleware will be run when the page is first loaded, but not on subsequent Livewire AJAX requests. If you want to run middleware on every request, you can make it persistent by passing `true` as the second argument to the `authMiddleware()` method:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->authMiddleware([
            // ...
        ], isPersistent: true);
}
```

## Disabling broadcasting

By default, Laravel Echo will automatically connect for every panel, if credentials have been set up in the [published `config/filament.php` configuration file](installation#publishing-configuration). To disable this automatic connection in a panel, you can use the `broadcasting(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->broadcasting(false);
}
```

# Documentation for panels. File: 10-clusters.md
---
title: Clusters
---

## Overview

Clusters are a hierarchical structure in panels that allow you to group [resources](resources) and [custom pages](pages) together. They are useful for organizing your panel into logical sections, and can help reduce the size of your panel's sidebar.

When using a cluster, a few things happen:

- A new navigation item is added to the navigation, which is a link to the first resource or page in the cluster.
- The individual navigation items for the resources or pages are no longer visible in the main navigation.
- A new sub-navigation UI is added to each resource or page in the cluster, which contains the navigation items for the resources or pages in the cluster.
- Resources and pages in the cluster get a new URL, prefixed with the name of the cluster. If you are generating URLs to [resources](resources/getting-started#generating-urls-to-resource-pages) and [pages](pages#generating-urls-to-pages) correctly, then this change should be handled for you automatically.
- The cluster's name is in the breadcrumbs of all resources and pages in the cluster. When clicking it, you are taken to the first resource or page in the cluster.

## Creating a cluster

Before creating your first cluster, you must tell the panel where cluster classes should be located. Alongside methods like `discoverResources()` and `discoverPages()` in the [configuration](configuration), you can use `discoverClusters()`:

```php
public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->discoverResources(in: app_path('Filament/Resources'), for: 'App\\Filament\\Resources')
        ->discoverPages(in: app_path('Filament/Pages'), for: 'App\\Filament\\Pages')
        ->discoverClusters(in: app_path('Filament/Clusters'), for: 'App\\Filament\\Clusters');
}
```

Now, you can create a cluster with the `php artisan make:filament-cluster` command:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-cluster Settings
```

This will create a new cluster class in the `app/Filament/Clusters` directory:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Filament\Clusters;

use Filament\Clusters\Cluster;

class Settings extends Cluster
{
    protected static ?string $navigationIcon = 'heroicon-o-squares-2x2';
}
```

The [`$navigationIcon`](navigation#customizing-a-navigation-items-icon) property is defined by default since you will most likely want to customize this immediately. All other [navigation properties and methods](navigation) are also available to use, including [`$navigationLabel`](navigation#customizing-a-navigation-items-label), [`$navigationSort`](navigation#sorting-navigation-items) and [`$navigationGroup`](navigation#grouping-navigation-items). These are used to customize the cluster's main navigation item, in the same way you would customize the item for a resource or page.

## Adding resources and pages to a cluster

To add resources and pages to a cluster, you just need to define the `$cluster` property on the resource or page class, and set it to the cluster class [you created](#creating-a-cluster):

```php
use App\Filament\Clusters\Settings;

protected static ?string $cluster = Settings::class;
```

## Code structure recommendations for panels using clusters

When using clusters, it is recommended that you move all of your resources and pages into a directory with the same name as the cluster. For example, here is a directory structure for a panel that uses a cluster called `Settings`, containing a `ColorResource` and two custom pages:

```
.
+-- Clusters
|   +-- Settings.php
|   +-- Settings
|   |   +-- Pages
|   |   |   +-- ManageBranding.php
|   |   |   +-- ManageNotifications.php
|   |   +-- Resources
|   |   |   +-- ColorResource.php
|   |   |   +-- ColorResource
|   |   |   |   +-- Pages
|   |   |   |   |   +-- CreateColor.php
|   |   |   |   |   +-- EditColor.php
|   |   |   |   |   +-- ListColors.php
```

This is a recommendation, not a requirement. You can structure your panel however you like, as long as the resources and pages in your cluster use the [`$cluster`](#adding-resources-and-pages-to-a-cluster) property. This is just a suggestion to help you keep your panel organized.

When a cluster exists in your panel, and you generate new resources or pages with the `make:filament-resource` or `make:filament-page` commands, you will be asked if you want to create them inside a cluster directory, according to these guidelines. If you choose to, then Filament will also assign the correct `$cluster` property to the resource or page class for you. If you do not, you will need to [define the `$cluster` property](#adding-resources-and-pages-to-a-cluster) yourself.

## Customizing the cluster breadcrumb

The cluster's name is in the breadcrumbs of all resources and pages in the cluster.

You may customize the breadcrumb name using the `$clusterBreadcrumb` property in the cluster class:

```php
protected static ?string $clusterBreadcrumb = 'cluster';
```

Alternatively, you may use the `getClusterBreadcrumb()` to define a dynamic breadcrumb name:

```php
public static function getClusterBreadcrumb(): string
{
    return __('filament/clusters/cluster.name');
}
```

# Documentation for panels. File: 11-tenancy.md
---
title: Multi-tenancy
---

## Overview

Multi-tenancy is a concept where a single instance of an application serves multiple customers. Each customer has their own data and access rules that prevent them from viewing or modifying each other's data. This is a common pattern in SaaS applications. Users often belong to groups of users (often called teams or organizations). Records are owned by the group, and users can be members of multiple groups. This is suitable for applications where users need to collaborate on data.

Multi-tenancy is a very sensitive topic. It's important to understand the security implications of multi-tenancy and how to properly implement it. If implemented partially or incorrectly, data belonging to one tenant may be exposed to another tenant. Filament provides a set of tools to help you implement multi-tenancy in your application, but it is up to you to understand how to use them. Filament does not provide any guarantees about the security of your application. It is your responsibility to ensure that your application is secure. Please see the [security](#tenancy-security) section for more information.

## Simple one-to-many tenancy

The term "multi-tenancy" is broad and may mean different things in different contexts. Filament's tenancy system implies that the user belongs to **many** tenants (*organizations, teams, companies, etc.*) and may switch between them.

If your case is simpler and you don't need a many-to-many relationship, then you don't need to set up the tenancy in Filament. You could use [observers](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent#observers) and [global scopes](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent#global-scopes) instead.

Let's say you have a database column `users.team_id`, you can scope all records to have the same `team_id` as the user using a [global scope](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent#global-scopes):

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

class Post extends Model
{
    protected static function booted(): void
    {
        static::addGlobalScope('team', function (Builder $query) {
            if (auth()->hasUser()) {
                $query->where('team_id', auth()->user()->team_id);
                // or with a `team` relationship defined:
                $query->whereBelongsTo(auth()->user()->team);
            }
        });
    }
}
```

To automatically set the `team_id` on the record when it's created, you can create an [observer](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent#observers):

```php
class PostObserver
{
    public function creating(Post $post): void
    {
        if (auth()->hasUser()) {
            $post->team_id = auth()->user()->team_id;
            // or with a `team` relationship defined:
            $post->team()->associate(auth()->user()->team);
        }
    }
}
```

## Setting up tenancy

To set up tenancy, you'll need to specify the "tenant" (like team or organization) model in the [configuration](configuration):

```php
use App\Models\Team;
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->tenant(Team::class);
}
```

You'll also need to tell Filament which tenants a user belongs to. You can do this by implementing the `HasTenants` interface on the `App\Models\User` model:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Filament\Models\Contracts\FilamentUser;
use Filament\Models\Contracts\HasTenants;
use Filament\Panel;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\BelongsToMany;
use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;
use Illuminate\Support\Collection;

class User extends Authenticatable implements FilamentUser, HasTenants
{
    // ...

    public function teams(): BelongsToMany
    {
        return $this->belongsToMany(Team::class);
    }

    public function getTenants(Panel $panel): Collection
    {
        return $this->teams;
    }

    public function canAccessTenant(Model $tenant): bool
    {
        return $this->teams()->whereKey($tenant)->exists();
    }
}
```

In this example, users belong to many teams, so there is a `teams()` relationship. The `getTenants()` method returns the teams that the user belongs to. Filament uses this to list the tenants that the user has access to.

For security, you also need to implement the `canAccessTenant()` method of the `HasTenants` interface to prevent users from accessing the data of other tenants by guessing their tenant ID and putting it into the URL.

You'll also want users to be able to [register new teams](#adding-a-tenant-registration-page).

## Adding a tenant registration page

A registration page will allow users to create a new tenant.

When visiting your app after logging in, users will be redirected to this page if they don't already have a tenant.

To set up a registration page, you'll need to create a new page class that extends `Filament\Pages\Tenancy\RegisterTenant`. This is a full-page Livewire component. You can put this anywhere you want, such as `app/Filament/Pages/Tenancy/RegisterTeam.php`:

```php
namespace App\Filament\Pages\Tenancy;

use App\Models\Team;
use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Forms\Form;
use Filament\Pages\Tenancy\RegisterTenant;

class RegisterTeam extends RegisterTenant
{
    public static function getLabel(): string
    {
        return 'Register team';
    }

    public function form(Form $form): Form
    {
        return $form
            ->schema([
                TextInput::make('name'),
                // ...
            ]);
    }

    protected function handleRegistration(array $data): Team
    {
        $team = Team::create($data);

        $team->members()->attach(auth()->user());

        return $team;
    }
}
```

You may add any [form components](../forms/getting-started) to the `form()` method, and create the team inside the `handleRegistration()` method.

Now, we need to tell Filament to use this page. We can do this in the [configuration](configuration):

```php
use App\Filament\Pages\Tenancy\RegisterTeam;
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->tenantRegistration(RegisterTeam::class);
}
```

### Customizing the tenant registration page

You can override any method you want on the base registration page class to make it act as you want. Even the `$view` property can be overridden to use a custom view of your choice.

## Adding a tenant profile page

A profile page will allow users to edit information about the tenant.

To set up a profile page, you'll need to create a new page class that extends `Filament\Pages\Tenancy\EditTenantProfile`. This is a full-page Livewire component. You can put this anywhere you want, such as `app/Filament/Pages/Tenancy/EditTeamProfile.php`:

```php
namespace App\Filament\Pages\Tenancy;

use Filament\Forms\Components\TextInput;
use Filament\Forms\Form;
use Filament\Pages\Tenancy\EditTenantProfile;

class EditTeamProfile extends EditTenantProfile
{
    public static function getLabel(): string
    {
        return 'Team profile';
    }

    public function form(Form $form): Form
    {
        return $form
            ->schema([
                TextInput::make('name'),
                // ...
            ]);
    }
}
```

You may add any [form components](../forms/getting-started) to the `form()` method. They will get saved directly to the tenant model.

Now, we need to tell Filament to use this page. We can do this in the [configuration](configuration):

```php
use App\Filament\Pages\Tenancy\EditTeamProfile;
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->tenantProfile(EditTeamProfile::class);
}
```

### Customizing the tenant profile page

You can override any method you want on the base profile page class to make it act as you want. Even the `$view` property can be overridden to use a custom view of your choice.

## Accessing the current tenant

Anywhere in the app, you can access the tenant model for the current request using `Filament::getTenant()`:

```php
use Filament\Facades\Filament;

$tenant = Filament::getTenant();
```

## Billing

### Using Laravel Spark

Filament provides a billing integration with [Laravel Spark](https://spark.laravel.com). Your users can start subscriptions and manage their billing information.

To install the integration, first [install Spark](https://spark.laravel.com/docs/installation.html) and configure it for your tenant model.

Now, you can install the Filament billing provider for Spark using Composer:

```bash
composer require filament/spark-billing-provider
```

In the [configuration](configuration), set Spark as the `tenantBillingProvider()`:

```php
use Filament\Billing\Providers\SparkBillingProvider;
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->tenantBillingProvider(new SparkBillingProvider());
}
```

Now, you're all good to go! Users can manage their billing by clicking a link in the tenant menu.

### Requiring a subscription

To require a subscription to use any part of the app, you can use the `requiresTenantSubscription()` configuration method:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->requiresTenantSubscription();
}
```

Now, users will be redirected to the billing page if they don't have an active subscription.

#### Requiring a subscription for specific resources and pages

Sometimes, you may wish to only require a subscription for certain [resources](resources/getting-started) and [custom pages](pages) in your app. You can do this by returning `true` from the `isTenantSubscriptionRequired()` method on the resource or page class:

```php
public static function isTenantSubscriptionRequired(Panel $panel): bool
{
    return true;
}
```

If you're using the `requiresTenantSubscription()` configuration method, then you can return `false` from this method to allow access to the resource or page as an exception.

### Writing a custom billing integration

Billing integrations are quite simple to write. You just need a class that implements the `Filament\Billing\Providers\Contracts\Provider` interface. This interface has two methods.

`getRouteAction()` is used to get the route action that should be run when the user visits the billing page. This could be a callback function, or the name of a controller, or a Livewire component - anything that works when using `Route::get()` in Laravel normally. For example, you could put in a simple redirect to your own billing page using a callback function.

`getSubscribedMiddleware()` returns the name of a middleware that should be used to check if the tenant has an active subscription. This middleware should redirect the user to the billing page if they don't have an active subscription.

Here's an example billing provider that uses a callback function for the route action and a middleware for the subscribed middleware:

```php
use App\Http\Middleware\RedirectIfUserNotSubscribed;
use Filament\Billing\Providers\Contracts\Provider;
use Illuminate\Http\RedirectResponse;

class ExampleBillingProvider implements Provider
{
    public function getRouteAction(): string
    {
        return function (): RedirectResponse {
            return redirect('https://billing.example.com');
        };
    }

    public function getSubscribedMiddleware(): string
    {
        return RedirectIfUserNotSubscribed::class;
    }
}
```

### Customizing the billing route slug

You can customize the URL slug used for the billing route using the `tenantBillingRouteSlug()` method in the [configuration](configuration):

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->tenantBillingRouteSlug('billing');
}
```

## Customizing the tenant menu

The tenant-switching menu is featured in the admin layout. It's fully customizable.

To register new items to the tenant menu, you can use the [configuration](configuration):

```php
use App\Filament\Pages\Settings;
use Filament\Navigation\MenuItem;
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->tenantMenuItems([
            MenuItem::make()
                ->label('Settings')
                ->url(fn (): string => Settings::getUrl())
                ->icon('heroicon-m-cog-8-tooth'),
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

### Customizing the registration link

To customize the registration link on the tenant menu, register a new item with the `register` array key:

```php
use Filament\Navigation\MenuItem;
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->tenantMenuItems([
            'register' => MenuItem::make()->label('Register new team'),
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

### Customizing the profile link

To customize the profile link on the tenant menu, register a new item with the `profile` array key:

```php
use Filament\Navigation\MenuItem;
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->tenantMenuItems([
            'profile' => MenuItem::make()->label('Edit team profile'),
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

### Customizing the billing link

To customize the billing link on the tenant menu, register a new item with the `billing` array key:

```php
use Filament\Navigation\MenuItem;
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->tenantMenuItems([
            'billing' => MenuItem::make()->label('Manage subscription'),
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

### Conditionally hiding tenant menu items

You can also conditionally hide a tenant menu item by using the `visible()` or `hidden()` methods, passing in a condition to check. Passing a function will defer condition evaluation until the menu is actually being rendered:

```php
use Filament\Navigation\MenuItem;

MenuItem::make()
    ->label('Settings')
    ->visible(fn (): bool => auth()->user()->can('manage-team'))
    // or
    ->hidden(fn (): bool => ! auth()->user()->can('manage-team'))
```

### Sending a `POST` HTTP request from a tenant menu item

You can send a `POST` HTTP request from a tenant menu item by passing a URL to the `postAction()` method:

```php
use Filament\Navigation\MenuItem;

MenuItem::make()
    ->label('Lock session')
    ->postAction(fn (): string => route('lock-session'))
```

### Hiding the tenant menu

You can hide the tenant menu by using the `tenantMenu(false)`

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->tenantMenu(false);
}
```

However, this is a sign that Filament's tenancy feature is not suitable for your project. If each user only belongs to one tenant, you should stick to [simple one-to-many tenancy](#simple-one-to-many-tenancy).

## Setting up avatars

Out of the box, Filament uses [ui-avatars.com](https://ui-avatars.com) to generate avatars based on a user's name. However, if you user model has an `avatar_url` attribute, that will be used instead. To customize how Filament gets a user's avatar URL, you can implement the `HasAvatar` contract:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Filament\Models\Contracts\FilamentUser;
use Filament\Models\Contracts\HasAvatar;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Team extends Model implements HasAvatar
{
    // ...

    public function getFilamentAvatarUrl(): ?string
    {
        return $this->avatar_url;
    }
}
```

The `getFilamentAvatarUrl()` method is used to retrieve the avatar of the current user. If `null` is returned from this method, Filament will fall back to [ui-avatars.com](https://ui-avatars.com).

You can easily swap out [ui-avatars.com](https://ui-avatars.com) for a different service, by creating a new avatar provider. [You can learn how to do this here.](users#using-a-different-avatar-provider)

## Configuring the tenant relationships

When creating and listing records associated with a Tenant, Filament needs access to two Eloquent relationships for each resource - an "ownership" relationship that is defined on the resource model class, and a relationship on the tenant model class. By default, Filament will attempt to guess the names of these relationships based on standard Laravel conventions. For example, if the tenant model is `App\Models\Team`, it will look for a `team()` relationship on the resource model class. And if the resource model class is `App\Models\Post`, it will look for a `posts()` relationship on the tenant model class.

### Customizing the ownership relationship name

You can customize the name of the ownership relationship used across all resources at once, using the `ownershipRelationship` argument on the `tenant()` configuration method. In this example, resource model classes have an `owner` relationship defined:

```php
use App\Models\Team;
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->tenant(Team::class, ownershipRelationship: 'owner');
}
```

Alternatively, you can set the `$tenantOwnershipRelationshipName` static property on the resource class, which can then be used to customize the ownership relationship name that is just used for that resource. In this example, the `Post` model class has an `owner` relationship defined:

```php
use Filament\Resources\Resource;

class PostResource extends Resource
{
    protected static ?string $tenantOwnershipRelationshipName = 'owner';

    // ...
}
```

### Customizing the resource relationship name

You can set the `$tenantRelationshipName` static property on the resource class, which can then be used to customize the relationship name that is used to fetch that resource. In this example, the tenant model class has an `blogPosts` relationship defined:

```php
use Filament\Resources\Resource;

class PostResource extends Resource
{
    protected static ?string $tenantRelationshipName = 'blogPosts';

    // ...
}
```

## Configuring the slug attribute

When using a tenant like a team, you might want to add a slug field to the URL rather than the team's ID. You can do that with the `slugAttribute` argument on the `tenant()` configuration method:

```php
use App\Models\Team;
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->tenant(Team::class, slugAttribute: 'slug');
}
```

## Configuring the name attribute

By default, Filament will use the `name` attribute of the tenant to display its name in the app. To change this, you can implement the `HasName` contract:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Filament\Models\Contracts\HasName;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Team extends Model implements HasName
{
    // ...

    public function getFilamentName(): string
    {
        return "{$this->name} {$this->subscription_plan}";
    }
}
```

The `getFilamentName()` method is used to retrieve the name of the current user.

## Setting the current tenant label

Inside the tenant switcher, you may wish to add a small label like "Active team" above the name of the current team. You can do this by implementing the `HasCurrentTenantLabel` method on the tenant model:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Filament\Models\Contracts\HasCurrentTenantLabel;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Team extends Model implements HasCurrentTenantLabel
{
    // ...

    public function getCurrentTenantLabel(): string
    {
        return 'Active team';
    }
}
```

## Setting the default tenant

When signing in, Filament will redirect the user to the first tenant returned from the `getTenants()` method.

Sometimes, you might wish to change this. For example, you might store which team was last active, and redirect the user to that team instead.

To customize this, you can implement the `HasDefaultTenant` contract on the user:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Filament\Models\Contracts\FilamentUser;
use Filament\Models\Contracts\HasDefaultTenant;
use Filament\Models\Contracts\HasTenants;
use Filament\Panel;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\BelongsTo;

class User extends Model implements FilamentUser, HasDefaultTenant, HasTenants
{
    // ...

    public function getDefaultTenant(Panel $panel): ?Model
    {
        return $this->latestTeam;
    }

    public function latestTeam(): BelongsTo
    {
        return $this->belongsTo(Team::class, 'latest_team_id');
    }
}
```

## Applying middleware to tenant-aware routes

You can apply extra middleware to all tenant-aware routes by passing an array of middleware classes to the `tenantMiddleware()` method in the [panel configuration file](configuration):

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->tenantMiddleware([
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

By default, middleware will be run when the page is first loaded, but not on subsequent Livewire AJAX requests. If you want to run middleware on every request, you can make it persistent by passing `true` as the second argument to the `tenantMiddleware()` method:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->tenantMiddleware([
            // ...
        ], isPersistent: true);
}
```

## Adding a tenant route prefix

By default the URL structure will put the tenant ID or slug immediately after the panel path. If you wish to prefix it with another URL segment, use the `tenantRoutePrefix()` method:

```php
use App\Models\Team;
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->path('admin')
        ->tenant(Team::class)
        ->tenantRoutePrefix('team');
}
```

Before, the URL structure was `/admin/1` for tenant 1. Now, it is `/admin/team/1`.

## Using a domain to identify the tenant

When using a tenant, you might want to use domain or subdomain routing like `team1.example.com/posts` instead of a route prefix like `/team1/posts` . You can do that with the `tenantDomain()` method, alongside the `tenant()` configuration method. The `tenant` argument corresponds to the slug attribute of the tenant model:

```php
use App\Models\Team;
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->tenant(Team::class, slugAttribute: 'slug')
        ->tenantDomain('{tenant:slug}.example.com');
}
```

In the above examples, the tenants live on subdomains of the main app domain. You may also set the system up to resolve the entire domain from the tenant as well:

```php
use App\Models\Team;
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->tenant(Team::class, slugAttribute: 'domain')
        ->tenantDomain('{tenant:domain}');
}
```

In this example, the `domain` attribute should contain a valid domain host, like `example.com` or `subdomain.example.com`.

> Note: When using a parameter for the entire domain (`tenantDomain('{tenant:domain}')`), Filament will register a [global route parameter pattern](https://laravel.com/docs/routing#parameters-global-constraints) for all `tenant` parameters in the application to be `[a-z0-9.\-]+`. This is because Laravel does not allow the `.` character in route parameters by default. This might conflict with other panels using tenancy, or other parts of your application that use a `tenant` route parameter.

## Disabling tenancy for a resource

By default, all resources within a panel with tenancy will be scoped to the current tenant. If you have resources that are shared between tenants, you can disable tenancy for them by setting the `$isScopedToTenant` static property to `false` on the resource class:

```php
protected static bool $isScopedToTenant = false;
```

### Disabling tenancy for all resources

If you wish to opt-in to tenancy for each resource instead of opting-out, you can call `Resource::scopeToTenant(false)` inside a service provider's `boot()` method or a middleware:

```php
use Filament\Resources\Resource;

Resource::scopeToTenant(false);
```

Now, you can opt-in to tenancy for each resource by setting the `$isScopedToTenant` static property to `true` on a resource class:

```php
protected static bool $isScopedToTenant = true;
```

## Tenancy security

It's important to understand the security implications of multi-tenancy and how to properly implement it. If implemented partially or incorrectly, data belonging to one tenant may be exposed to another tenant. Filament provides a set of tools to help you implement multi-tenancy in your application, but it is up to you to understand how to use them. Filament does not provide any guarantees about the security of your application. It is your responsibility to ensure that your application is secure.

Below is a list of features that Filament provides to help you implement multi-tenancy in your application:

- Automatic scoping of resources to the current tenant. The base Eloquent query that is used to fetch records for a resource is automatically scoped to the current tenant. This query is used to render the resource's list table, and is also used to resolve records from the current URL when editing or viewing a record. This means that if a user attempts to view a record that does not belong to the current tenant, they will receive a 404 error.

- Automatic association of new resource records to the current tenant.

And here are the things that Filament does not currently provide:

- Scoping of relation manager records to the current tenant. When using the relation manager, in the vast majority of cases, the query will not need to be scoped to the current tenant, since it is already scoped to the parent record, which is itself scoped to the current tenant. For example, if a `Team` tenant model had an `Author` resource, and that resource had a `posts` relationship and relation manager set up, and posts only belong to one author, there is no need to scope the query. This is because the user will only be able to see authors that belong to the current team anyway, and thus will only be able to see posts that belong to those authors. You can [scope the Eloquent query](resources/relation-managers#customizing-the-relation-manager-eloquent-query) if you wish.

- Form component and filter scoping. When using the `Select`, `CheckboxList` or `Repeater` form components, the `SelectFilter`, or any other similar Filament component which is able to automatically fetch "options" or other data from the database (usually using a `relationship()` method), this data is not scoped. The main reason for this is that these features often don't belong to the Filament Panel Builder package, and have no knowledge that they are being used within that context, and that a tenant even exists. And even if they did have access to the tenant, there is nowhere for the tenant relationship configuration to live. To scope these components, you need to pass in a query function that scopes the query to the current tenant. For example, if you were using the `Select` form component to select an `author` from a relationship, you could do this:

```php
use Filament\Facades\Filament;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

Select::make('author_id')
    ->relationship(
        name: 'author',
        titleAttribute: 'name',
        modifyQueryUsing: fn (Builder $query) => $query->whereBelongsTo(Filament::getTenant()),
    );
```

### Using tenant-aware middleware to apply global scopes

It might be useful to apply global scopes to your Eloquent models while they are being used in your panel. This would allow you to forget about scoping your queries to the current tenant, and instead have the scoping applied automatically. To do this, you can create a new middleware class like `ApplyTenantScopes`:

```bash
php artisan make:middleware ApplyTenantScopes
```

Inside the `handle()` method, you can apply any global scopes that you wish:

```php
use App\Models\Author;
use Closure;
use Filament\Facades\Filament;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class ApplyTenantScopes
{
    public function handle(Request $request, Closure $next)
    {
        Author::addGlobalScope(
            fn (Builder $query) => $query->whereBelongsTo(Filament::getTenant()),
        );

        return $next($request);
    }
}
```

You can now [register this middleware](#applying-middleware-to-tenant-aware-routes) for all tenant-aware routes, and ensure that it is used across all Livewire AJAX requests by making it persistent:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->tenantMiddleware([
            ApplyTenantScopes::class,
        ], isPersistent: true);
}
```

## Changing the colors

In the [configuration](configuration), you can easily change the colors that are used. Filament ships with 6 predefined colors that are used everywhere within the framework. They are customizable as follows:

```php
use Filament\Panel;
use Filament\Support\Colors\Color;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->colors([
            'danger' => Color::Rose,
            'gray' => Color::Gray,
            'info' => Color::Blue,
            'primary' => Color::Indigo,
            'success' => Color::Emerald,
            'warning' => Color::Orange,
        ]);
}
```

The `Filament\Support\Colors\Color` class contains color options for all [Tailwind CSS color palettes](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors).

You can also pass in a function to `register()` which will only get called when the app is getting rendered. This is useful if you are calling `register()` from a service provider, and want to access objects like the currently authenticated user, which are initialized later in middleware.

Alternatively, you may pass your own palette in as an array of RGB values:

```php
$panel
    ->colors([
        'primary' => [
            50 => '238, 242, 255',
            100 => '224, 231, 255',
            200 => '199, 210, 254',
            300 => '165, 180, 252',
            400 => '129, 140, 248',
            500 => '99, 102, 241',
            600 => '79, 70, 229',
            700 => '67, 56, 202',
            800 => '55, 48, 163',
            900 => '49, 46, 129',
            950 => '30, 27, 75',
        ],
    ])
```

### Generating a color palette

If you want us to attempt to generate a palette for you based on a singular hex or RGB value, you can pass that in:

```php
$panel
    ->colors([
        'primary' => '#6366f1',
    ])

$panel
    ->colors([
        'primary' => 'rgb(99, 102, 241)',
    ])
```

## Changing the font

By default, we use the [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) font. You can change this using the `font()` method in the [configuration](configuration) file:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->font('Poppins');
}
```

All [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) are available to use.

### Changing the font provider

[Bunny Fonts CDN](https://fonts.bunny.net) is used to serve the fonts. It is GDPR-compliant. If you'd like to use [Google Fonts CDN](https://fonts.google.com) instead, you can do so using the `provider` argument of the `font()` method:

```php
use Filament\FontProviders\GoogleFontProvider;

$panel->font('Inter', provider: GoogleFontProvider::class)
```

Or if you'd like to serve the fonts from a local stylesheet, you can use the `LocalFontProvider`:

```php
use Filament\FontProviders\LocalFontProvider;

$panel->font(
    'Inter',
    url: asset('css/fonts.css'),
    provider: LocalFontProvider::class,
)
```

## Creating a custom theme

Filament allows you to change the CSS used to render the UI by compiling a custom stylesheet to replace the default one. This custom stylesheet is called a "theme".

Themes use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), the Tailwind Forms plugin, the Tailwind Typography plugin, the [PostCSS Nesting plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postcss-nesting), and [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer).

> Filament v3 uses Tailwind CSS v3 for styling. As such, when creating a theme, you need to use Tailwind CSS v3. The `php artisan make:filament-theme` command will install Tailwind CSS v3 if you do not have it installed already. If you have Tailwind CSS v4 installed, it will not fully install the necessary Vite configuration to compile the theme. We suggest that you either use the Tailwind CLI to compile the theme, or downgrade your project to Tailwind CSS v3. The command to compile the theme with the Tailwind CLI will be output when you run the `make:filament-theme` command. You could save this command into a script in `package.json` for easy use.
> 
> Filament v4 will support Tailwind CSS v4.

To create a custom theme for a panel, you can use the `php artisan make:filament-theme` command:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-theme
```

If you have multiple panels, you can specify the panel you want to create a theme for:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-theme admin
```

By default, this command will use NPM to install dependencies. If you want to use a different package manager, you can use the `--pm` option:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-theme --pm=bun
````

The command will create a CSS file and Tailwind Configuration file in the `/resources/css/filament` directory. You can then customize the theme by editing these files. It will also give you instructions on how to compile the theme and register it in Filament. **Please follow the instructions in the command to complete the setup process:**

```
⇂ First, add a new item to the `input` array of `vite.config.js`: `resources/css/filament/admin/theme.css`
⇂ Next, register the theme in the admin panel provider using `->viteTheme('resources/css/filament/admin/theme.css')`
⇂ Finally, run `npm run build` to compile the theme
```

Please reference the command to see the exact file names that you need to register, they may not be `admin/theme.css`.

If you have Tailwind v4 installed, the output may look like this:

```
⇂ It looks like you have Tailwind v4 installed. Filament uses Tailwind v3. You should downgrade your project and re-run this command with `--force`, or use the following command to compile the theme with the Tailwind v3 CLI:
⇂ npx tailwindcss@3 --input ./resources/css/filament/admin/theme.css --output ./public/css/filament/admin/theme.css --config ./resources/css/filament/admin/tailwind.config.js --minify
⇂ Make sure to register the theme in the admin panel provider using `->theme(asset('css/filament/admin/theme.css'))`
```

## Disabling dark mode

To disable dark mode switching, you can use the [configuration](configuration) file:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->darkMode(false);
}
```

## Changing the default theme mode

By default, Filament uses the user's system theme as the default mode. For example, if the user's computer is in dark mode, Filament will use dark mode by default. The system mode in Filament is reactive if the user changes their computer's mode. If you want to change the default mode to force light or dark mode, you can use the `defaultThemeMode()` method, passing `ThemeMode::Light` or `ThemeMode::Dark`:

```php
use Filament\Enums\ThemeMode;
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->defaultThemeMode(ThemeMode::Light);
}
```

## Adding a logo

By default, Filament uses your app's name to render a simple text-based logo. However, you can easily customize this.

If you want to simply change the text that is used in the logo, you can use the `brandName()` method:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->brandName('Filament Demo');
}
```

To render an image instead, you can pass a URL to the `brandLogo()` method:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->brandLogo(asset('images/logo.svg'));
}
```

Alternatively, you may directly pass HTML to the `brandLogo()` method to render an inline SVG element for example:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->brandLogo(fn () => view('filament.admin.logo'));
}
```

```blade
<svg
    viewBox="0 0 128 26"
    xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
    class="h-full fill-gray-500 dark:fill-gray-400"
>
    <!-- ... -->
</svg>
```

If you need a different logo to be used when the application is in dark mode, you can pass it to `darkModeBrandLogo()` in the same way.

The logo height defaults to a sensible value, but it's impossible to account for all possible aspect ratios. Therefore, you may customize the height of the rendered logo using the `brandLogoHeight()` method:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->brandLogo(fn () => view('filament.admin.logo'))
        ->brandLogoHeight('2rem');
}
```


## Adding a favicon

To add a favicon, you can use the [configuration](configuration) file, passing the public URL of the favicon:

```php
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->favicon(asset('images/favicon.png'));
}
```

## Overview

The basis of Filament plugins are Laravel packages. They are installed into your Filament project via Composer, and follow all the standard techniques, like using service providers to register routes, views, and translations. If you're new to Laravel package development, here are some resources that can help you grasp the core concepts:

- [The Package Development section of the Laravel docs](https://laravel.com/docs/packages) serves as a great reference guide.
- [Spatie's Package Training course](https://spatie.be/products/laravel-package-training) is a good instructional video series to teach you the process step by step.
- [Spatie's Package Tools](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-package-tools) allows you to simplify your service provider classes using a fluent configuration object.

Filament plugins build on top of the concepts of Laravel packages and allow you to ship and consume reusable features for any Filament panel. They can be added to each panel one at a time, and are also configurable differently per-panel.

## Configuring the panel with a plugin class

A plugin class is used to allow your package to interact with a panel [configuration](configuration) file. It's a simple PHP class that implements the `Plugin` interface. 3 methods are required:

- The `getId()` method returns the unique identifier of the plugin amongst other plugins. Please ensure that it is specific enough to not clash with other plugins that might be used in the same project.
- The `register()` method allows you to use any [configuration](configuration) option that is available to the panel. This includes registering [resources](resources/getting-started), [custom pages](pages), [themes](themes), [render hooks](configuration#render-hooks) and more.
- The `boot()` method is run only when the panel that the plugin is being registered to is actually in-use. It is executed by a middleware class.

```php
<?php

namespace DanHarrin\FilamentBlog;

use DanHarrin\FilamentBlog\Pages\Settings;
use DanHarrin\FilamentBlog\Resources\CategoryResource;
use DanHarrin\FilamentBlog\Resources\PostResource;
use Filament\Contracts\Plugin;
use Filament\Panel;

class BlogPlugin implements Plugin
{
    public function getId(): string
    {
        return 'blog';
    }

    public function register(Panel $panel): void
    {
        $panel
            ->resources([
                PostResource::class,
                CategoryResource::class,
            ])
            ->pages([
                Settings::class,
            ]);
    }

    public function boot(Panel $panel): void
    {
        //
    }
}
```

The users of your plugin can add it to a panel by instantiating the plugin class and passing it to the `plugin()` method of the [configuration](configuration):

```php
use DanHarrin\FilamentBlog\BlogPlugin;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->plugin(new BlogPlugin());
}
```

### Fluently instantiating the plugin class

You may want to add a `make()` method to your plugin class to provide a fluent interface for your users to instantiate it. In addition, by using the container (`app()`) to instantiate the plugin object, it can be replaced with a different implementation at runtime:

```php
use Filament\Contracts\Plugin;

class BlogPlugin implements Plugin
{
    public static function make(): static
    {
        return app(static::class);
    }
    
    // ...
}
```

Now, your users can use the `make()` method:

```php
use DanHarrin\FilamentBlog\BlogPlugin;
use Filament\Panel;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        // ...
        ->plugin(BlogPlugin::make());
}
```

### Configuring plugins per-panel

You may add other methods to your plugin class, which allow your users to configure it. We suggest that you add both a setter and a getter method for each option you provide. You should use a property to store the preference in the setter and retrieve it again in the getter:

```php
use DanHarrin\FilamentBlog\Resources\AuthorResource;
use Filament\Contracts\Plugin;
use Filament\Panel;

class BlogPlugin implements Plugin
{
    protected bool $hasAuthorResource = false;
    
    public function authorResource(bool $condition = true): static
    {
        // This is the setter method, where the user's preference is
        // stored in a property on the plugin object.
        $this->hasAuthorResource = $condition;
    
        // The plugin object is returned from the setter method to
        // allow fluent chaining of configuration options.
        return $this;
    }
    
    public function hasAuthorResource(): bool
    {
        // This is the getter method, where the user's preference
        // is retrieved from the plugin property.
        return $this->hasAuthorResource;
    }
    
    public function register(Panel $panel): void
    {
        // Since the `register()` method is executed after the user
        // configures the plugin, you can access any of their
        // preferences inside it.
        if ($this->hasAuthorResource()) {
            // Here, we only register the author resource on the
            // panel if the user has requested it.
            $panel->resources([
                AuthorResource::class,
            ]);
        }
    }
    
    // ...
}
```

Additionally, you can use the unique ID of the plugin to access any of its configuration options from outside the plugin class. To do this, pass the ID to the `filament()` method:

```php
filament('blog')->hasAuthorResource()
```

You may wish to have better type safety and IDE autocompletion when accessing configuration. It's completely up to you how you choose to achieve this, but one idea could be adding a static method to the plugin class to retrieve it:

```php
use Filament\Contracts\Plugin;

class BlogPlugin implements Plugin
{
    public static function get(): static
    {
        return filament(app(static::class)->getId());
    }
    
    // ...
}
```

Now, you can access the plugin configuration using the new static method:

```php
BlogPlugin::get()->hasAuthorResource()
```

## Distributing a panel in a plugin

It's very easy to distribute an entire panel in a Laravel package. This way, a user can simply install your plugin and have an entirely new part of their app pre-built.

When [configuring](configuration) a panel, the configuration class extends the `PanelProvider` class, and that is a standard Laravel service provider. You can use it as a service provider in your package:

```php
<?php

namespace DanHarrin\FilamentBlog;

use Filament\Panel;
use Filament\PanelProvider;

class BlogPanelProvider extends PanelProvider
{
    public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
    {
        return $panel
            ->id('blog')
            ->path('blog')
            ->resources([
                // ...
            ])
            ->pages([
                // ...
            ])
            ->widgets([
                // ...
            ])
            ->middleware([
                // ...
            ])
            ->authMiddleware([
                // ...
            ]);
    }
}
```

You should then register it as a service provider in the `composer.json` of your package:

```json
"extra": {
    "laravel": {
        "providers": [
            "DanHarrin\\FilamentBlog\\BlogPanelProvider"
        ]
    }
}
```

# Documentation for panels. File: 14-testing.md
---
title: Testing
---

## Overview

All examples in this guide will be written using [Pest](https://pestphp.com). To use Pest's Livewire plugin for testing, you can follow the installation instructions in the Pest documentation on plugins: [Livewire plugin for Pest](https://pestphp.com/docs/plugins#livewire). However, you can easily adapt this to PHPUnit.

Since all pages in the app are Livewire components, we're just using Livewire testing helpers everywhere. If you've never tested Livewire components before, please read [this guide](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/testing) from the Livewire docs.

## Getting started

Ensure that you are authenticated to access the app in your `TestCase`:

```php
protected function setUp(): void
{
    parent::setUp();

    $this->actingAs(User::factory()->create());
}
```

### Testing multiple panels

If you have multiple panels and you would like to test a non-default panel, you will need to tell Filament which panel you are testing. This can be done in the `setUp()` method of the test case, or you can do it at the start of a particular test. Filament usually does this in a middleware when you access the panel through a request, so if you're not making a request in your test like when testing a Livewire component, you need to set the current panel manually:

```php
use Filament\Facades\Filament;

Filament::setCurrentPanel(
    Filament::getPanel('app'), // Where `app` is the ID of the panel you want to test.
);
```

## Resources

### Pages

#### List

##### Routing & render

To ensure that the List page for the `PostResource` is able to render successfully, generate a page URL, perform a request to this URL and ensure that it is successful:

```php
it('can render page', function () {
    $this->get(PostResource::getUrl('index'))->assertSuccessful();
});
```

##### Table

Filament includes a selection of helpers for testing tables. A full guide to testing tables can be found [in the Table Builder documentation](../tables/testing).

To use a table [testing helper](../tables/testing), make assertions on the resource's List page class, which holds the table:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can list posts', function () {
    $posts = Post::factory()->count(10)->create();

    livewire(PostResource\Pages\ListPosts::class)
        ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($posts);
});
```

#### Create

##### Routing & render

To ensure that the Create page for the `PostResource` is able to render successfully, generate a page URL, perform a request to this URL and ensure that it is successful:

```php
it('can render page', function () {
    $this->get(PostResource::getUrl('create'))->assertSuccessful();
});
```

##### Creating

You may check that data is correctly saved into the database by calling `fillForm()` with your form data, and then asserting that the database contains a matching record:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can create', function () {
    $newData = Post::factory()->make();

    livewire(PostResource\Pages\CreatePost::class)
        ->fillForm([
            'author_id' => $newData->author->getKey(),
            'content' => $newData->content,
            'tags' => $newData->tags,
            'title' => $newData->title,
        ])
        ->call('create')
        ->assertHasNoFormErrors();

    $this->assertDatabaseHas(Post::class, [
        'author_id' => $newData->author->getKey(),
        'content' => $newData->content,
        'tags' => json_encode($newData->tags),
        'title' => $newData->title,
    ]);
});
```

##### Validation

Use `assertHasFormErrors()` to ensure that data is properly validated in a form:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can validate input', function () {
    livewire(PostResource\Pages\CreatePost::class)
        ->fillForm([
            'title' => null,
        ])
        ->call('create')
        ->assertHasFormErrors(['title' => 'required']);
});
```

#### Edit

##### Routing & render

To ensure that the Edit page for the `PostResource` is able to render successfully, generate a page URL, perform a request to this URL and ensure that it is successful:

```php
it('can render page', function () {
    $this->get(PostResource::getUrl('edit', [
        'record' => Post::factory()->create(),
    ]))->assertSuccessful();
});
```

##### Filling existing data

To check that the form is filled with the correct data from the database, you may `assertFormSet()` that the data in the form matches that of the record:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can retrieve data', function () {
    $post = Post::factory()->create();

    livewire(PostResource\Pages\EditPost::class, [
        'record' => $post->getRouteKey(),
    ])
        ->assertFormSet([
            'author_id' => $post->author->getKey(),
            'content' => $post->content,
            'tags' => $post->tags,
            'title' => $post->title,
        ]);
});
```

##### Saving

You may check that data is correctly saved into the database by calling `fillForm()` with your form data, and then asserting that the database contains a matching record:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can save', function () {
    $post = Post::factory()->create();
    $newData = Post::factory()->make();

    livewire(PostResource\Pages\EditPost::class, [
        'record' => $post->getRouteKey(),
    ])
        ->fillForm([
            'author_id' => $newData->author->getKey(),
            'content' => $newData->content,
            'tags' => $newData->tags,
            'title' => $newData->title,
        ])
        ->call('save')
        ->assertHasNoFormErrors();

    expect($post->refresh())
        ->author_id->toBe($newData->author->getKey())
        ->content->toBe($newData->content)
        ->tags->toBe($newData->tags)
        ->title->toBe($newData->title);
});
```

##### Validation

Use `assertHasFormErrors()` to ensure that data is properly validated in a form:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can validate input', function () {
    $post = Post::factory()->create();

    livewire(PostResource\Pages\EditPost::class, [
        'record' => $post->getRouteKey(),
    ])
        ->fillForm([
            'title' => null,
        ])
        ->call('save')
        ->assertHasFormErrors(['title' => 'required']);
});
```

##### Deleting

You can test the `DeleteAction` using `callAction()`:

```php
use Filament\Actions\DeleteAction;
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can delete', function () {
    $post = Post::factory()->create();

    livewire(PostResource\Pages\EditPost::class, [
        'record' => $post->getRouteKey(),
    ])
        ->callAction(DeleteAction::class);

    $this->assertModelMissing($post);
});
```

You can ensure that a particular user is not able to see a `DeleteAction` using `assertActionHidden()`:

```php
use Filament\Actions\DeleteAction;
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can not delete', function () {
    $post = Post::factory()->create();

    livewire(PostResource\Pages\EditPost::class, [
        'record' => $post->getRouteKey(),
    ])
        ->assertActionHidden(DeleteAction::class);
});
```

#### View

##### Routing & render

To ensure that the View page for the `PostResource` is able to render successfully, generate a page URL, perform a request to this URL and ensure that it is successful:

```php
it('can render page', function () {
    $this->get(PostResource::getUrl('view', [
        'record' => Post::factory()->create(),
    ]))->assertSuccessful();
});
```

##### Filling existing data

To check that the form is filled with the correct data from the database, you may `assertFormSet()` that the data in the form matches that of the record:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can retrieve data', function () {
    $post = Post::factory()->create();

    livewire(PostResource\Pages\ViewPost::class, [
        'record' => $post->getRouteKey(),
    ])
        ->assertFormSet([
            'author_id' => $post->author->getKey(),
            'content' => $post->content,
            'tags' => $post->tags,
            'title' => $post->title,
        ]);
});
```

### Relation managers

##### Render

To ensure that a relation manager is able to render successfully, mount the Livewire component:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\CategoryResource\Pages\EditCategory;
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can render relation manager', function () {
    $category = Category::factory()
        ->has(Post::factory()->count(10))
        ->create();

    livewire(CategoryResource\RelationManagers\PostsRelationManager::class, [
        'ownerRecord' => $category,
        'pageClass' => EditCategory::class,
    ])
        ->assertSuccessful();
});
```

##### Table

Filament includes a selection of helpers for testing tables. A full guide to testing tables can be found [in the Table Builder documentation](../tables/testing).

To use a table [testing helper](../tables/testing), make assertions on the relation manager class, which holds the table:

```php
use App\Filament\Resources\CategoryResource\Pages\EditCategory;
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can list posts', function () {
    $category = Category::factory()
        ->has(Post::factory()->count(10))
        ->create();

    livewire(CategoryResource\RelationManagers\PostsRelationManager::class, [
        'ownerRecord' => $category,
        'pageClass' => EditCategory::class,
    ])
        ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($category->posts);
});
```

title: Upgrading from v2.x
---

> If you see anything missing from this guide, please do not hesitate to [make a pull request](https://github.com/filamentphp/filament/edit/3.x/packages/panels/docs/14-upgrade-guide.md) to our repository! Any help is appreciated!

## New requirements

- Laravel v10.0+
- Livewire v3.0+

Please upgrade Filament before upgrading to Livewire v3. Instructions on how to upgrade Livewire can be found [here](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/upgrading).

## Upgrading automatically

The easiest way to upgrade your app is to run the automated upgrade script. This script will automatically upgrade your application to the latest version of Filament and make changes to your code, which handles most breaking changes.

```bash
composer require filament/upgrade:"^3.2" -W --dev

vendor/bin/filament-v3
```

Make sure to carefully follow the instructions, and review the changes made by the script. You may need to make some manual changes to your code afterwards, but the script should handle most of the repetitive work for you.

A new `app/Providers/Filament/*PanelProvider.php` file will be created, and the configuration from your old `config/filament.php` file should be copied. Since this is a [Laravel service provider](https://laravel.com/docs/providers), it needs to be registered in `config/app.php`. Filament will attempt to do this for you, but if you get an error while trying to access your panel, then this process has probably failed. You can manually register the service provider by adding it to the `providers` array.

Finally, you must run `php artisan filament:install` to finalize the Filament v3 installation. This command must be run for all new Filament projects.

You can now `composer remove filament/upgrade` as you don't need it anymore.

> Some plugins you're using may not be available in v3 just yet. You could temporarily remove them from your `composer.json` file until they've been upgraded, replace them with a similar plugins that are v3-compatible, wait for the plugins to be upgraded before upgrading your app, or even write PRs to help the authors upgrade them.

## Upgrading manually

After upgrading the dependency via Composer, you should execute `php artisan filament:upgrade` in order to clear any Laravel caches and publish the new frontend assets.

### High-impact changes

#### Panel provider instead of the config file

The Filament v2 config file grew pretty big, and now it is incredibly small. Most of the configuration is now done in a service provider, which provides a cleaner API, more type safety, IDE autocomplete support, and [the ability to create multiple panels in your app](configuration#introducing-panels). We call these special configuration service providers **"panel providers"**.

Before you can create the new panel provider, make sure that you've got Filament v3 installed with Composer. Then, run the following command:

```bash
php artisan filament:install --panels
```

A new `app/Providers/Filament/AdminPanelProvider.php` file will be created, ready for you to transfer over your old configuration from the `config/filament.php` file. Since this is a [Laravel service provider](https://laravel.com/docs/providers), it needs to be registered in `config/app.php`. Filament will attempt to do this for you, but if you get an error while trying to access your panel, then this process has probably failed. You can manually register the service provider by adding it to the `providers` array.

Most configuration transfer is very self-explanatory, but if you get stuck, please refer to the [configuration documentation](configuration).

This will especially affect configuration done via the `Filament::serving()` method, which was used for theme customization, navigation and menu registration. Consult the [configuration](configuration), [navigation](navigation) and [themes](themes) documentation sections.

Finally, you can run the following command to replace the old config file with the shiny new one:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=filament-config --force
```

#### `FILAMENT_FILESYSTEM_DRIVER` .env variable

The `FILAMENT_FILESYSTEM_DRIVER` .env variable has been renamed to `FILAMENT_FILESYSTEM_DISK`. This is to make it more consistent with Laravel, as Laravel v9 introduced this change as well. Please ensure that you update your .env files accordingly, and don't forget production!

#### Resource and relation manager imports

Some classes that are imported in resources and relation managers have moved:

- `Filament\Resources\Form` has moved to `Filament\Forms\Form`
- `Filament\Resources\Table` has moved to `Filament\Tables\Table`

#### Method signature changes

User model (with `FilamentUser` interface):

- `canAccessFilament()` has been renamed to `canAccessPanel()` and has a new `\Filament\Panel $panel` parameter

Resource classes:

- `applyGlobalSearchAttributeConstraint()` now has a `string $search` parameter before `$searchAttributes()` instead of `$searchQuery` after
- `getGlobalSearchEloquentQuery()` is public
- `getGlobalSearchResults()`has a `$search` parameter instead of `$searchQuery`
- `getRouteBaseName()` has a new `?string $panel` parameter

Resource classes and all page classes, including resource pages, custom pages, settings pages, and dashboard pages:

- `getActiveNavigationIcon()` is public
- `getNavigationBadge()` is public
- `getNavigationBadgeColor()` is public
- `getNavigationGroup()` is public
- `getNavigationIcon()` is public
- `getNavigationLabel()` is public
- `getNavigationSort()` is public
- `getNavigationUrl()` is public
- `shouldRegisterNavigation()` is public

All page classes, including resource pages, custom pages, settings pages, and custom dashboard pages:

- `getBreadcrumbs()` is public
- `getFooterWidgetsColumns()` is public
- `getHeader()` is public
- `getHeaderWidgetsColumns()` is public
- `getHeading()` is public
- `getRouteName()` has a new `?string $panel` parameter
- `getSubheading()` is public
- `getTitle()` is public
- `getVisibleFooterWidgets()` is public
- `getVisibleHeaderWidgets()` is public

List and Manage resource pages:

- `table()` is public

Create resource pages:

- `canCreateAnother()` is public

Edit and View resource pages:

- `getFormTabLabel()` is now `getContentTabLabel()`

Relation managers:

- `form()` is no longer static
- `getInverseRelationshipName()` return type is now `?string`
- `table()` is no longer static

Custom dashboard pages:

- `getDashboard()` is public
- `getWidgets()` is public

#### Property signature changes

Resource classes and all page classes, including resource pages, custom pages, settings pages, and dashboard pages:

- `$middlewares` is now `$routeMiddleware`

#### Heroicons have been updated to v2

The Heroicons library has been updated to v2. This means that any icons you use in your app may have changed names. You can find a list of changes [here](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/heroicons/releases/tag/v2.0.0).

### Medium-impact changes

#### Date-time pickers

The date-time picker form field now uses the browser's native date picker by default. It usually has a better UX than the old date picker, but you may notice features missing, bad browser compatibility, or behavioral bugs. If you want to revert to the old date picker, you can use the `native(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\DateTimePicker;

DateTimePicker::make('published_at')
    ->native(false)
```

#### Secondary color

Filament v2 had a `secondary` color for many components which was gray. All references to `secondary` should be replaced with `gray` to preserve the same appearance. This frees `secondary` to be registered to a new custom color of your choice.

#### `$get` and `$set` closure parameters

In the Form Builder package, `$get` and `$set` parameters now use a type of either `\Filament\Forms\Get` or `\Filament\Forms\Set` instead of `\Closure`. This allows for better IDE autocomplete support of each function's parameters.

An easy way to upgrade your code quickly is to find and replace:

- `Closure $get` to `\Filament\Forms\Get $get`
- `Closure $set` to `\Filament\Forms\Set $set`

#### Blade icon components have been disabled

During v2, we noticed performance issues with Blade icon components. We've decided to disable them by default in v3, so we only use the [`@svg()` syntax](https://github.com/blade-ui-kit/blade-icons#directive) for rendering icons.

A side effect of this change is that all custom icons that you use must now be [registered in a set](https://github.com/blade-ui-kit/blade-icons#defining-sets). We no longer allow arbitrary Blade components to be used as custom icons.

#### Logo customization

In v2, you can customize the logo of the admin panel using a `/resources/views/vendor/filament/components/brand.blade.php` file. In v3, this has been moved to the new `brandLogo()` API. You can now [set the brand logo](themes#adding-a-logo) by adding it to your panel configuration.

#### Plugins

Filament v3 has a new universal plugin system that breaches the constraints of the admin panel. Learn how to build v3 plugins [here](plugins).

### Low-impact changes

#### Default actions and type-specific relation manager classes

> If you started the Filament project after v2.13, you can skip this section. Since then, new resources and relation managers have been generated with the new syntax.

Since v2.13, resources and relation managers now define actions within the `table()` method instead of them being assumed by default.

When using simple resources, remove the `CanCreateRecords`, `CanDeleteRecords`, `CanEditRecords`, and `CanViewRecords` traits from the Manage page.

We also deprecated type-specific relation manager classes. Any classes extending `BelongsToManyRelationManager`, `HasManyRelationManager`, `HasManyThroughRelationManager`, `MorphManyRelationManager`, or `MorphToManyRelationManager` should now extend `\Filament\Resources\RelationManagers\RelationManager`. You can also remove the `CanAssociateRecords`, `CanAttachRecords`, `CanCreateRecords`, `CanDeleteRecords`, `CanDetachRecords`, `CanDisassociateRecords`, `CanEditRecords`, and `CanViewRecords` traits from relation managers.

To learn more about v2.13 changes, read our [blog post](https://v2.filamentphp.com/blog/v2130-admin-resources).

#### Blade components

Some Blade components have been moved to different namespaces:

- `<x-filament::page>` is now `<x-filament-panels::page>`
- `<x-filament::widget>` is now `<x-filament-widgets::widget>`

However, aliases have been set up so that you don't need to change your code.

#### Resource pages without a `$resource` property

Filament v2 allowed for resource pages to be created without a `$resource` property. In v3 you must declare this, else you may end up with the error:

`Typed static property Filament\Resources\Pages\Page::$resource must not be accessed before initialization`

You should ensure that the `$resource` property is set on all resource pages:

```php
protected static string $resource = PostResource::class;
```

    url="https://laracasts.com/series/build-advanced-components-for-filament/episodes/14"
    series="building-advanced-components"
/>

## Overview

All packages in the Filament ecosystem share an asset management system. This allows both official plugins and third-party plugins to register CSS and JavaScript files that can then be consumed by Blade views.

## The `FilamentAsset` facade

The `FilamentAsset` facade is used to register files into the asset system. These files may be sourced from anywhere in the filesystem, but are then copied into the `/public` directory of the application when the `php artisan filament:assets` command is run. By copying them into the `/public` directory for you, we can predictably load them in Blade views, and also ensure that third party packages are able to load their assets without having to worry about where they are located.

Assets always have a unique ID chosen by you, which is used as the file name when the asset is copied into the `/public` directory. This ID is also used to reference the asset in Blade views. While the ID is unique, if you are registering assets for a plugin, then you do not need to worry about IDs clashing with other plugins, since the asset will be copied into a directory named after your plugin.

The `FilamentAsset` facade should be used in the `boot()` method of a service provider. It can be used inside an application service provider such as `AppServiceProvider`, or inside a plugin service provider.

The `FilamentAsset` facade has one main method, `register()`, which accepts an array of assets to register:

```php
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentAsset;

public function boot(): void
{
    // ...
    
    FilamentAsset::register([
        // ...
    ]);
    
    // ...
}
```

### Registering assets for a plugin

When registering assets for a plugin, you should pass the name of the Composer package as the second argument of the `register()` method:

```php
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentAsset;

FilamentAsset::register([
    // ...
], package: 'danharrin/filament-blog');
```

Now, all the assets for this plugin will be copied into their own directory inside `/public`, to avoid the possibility of clashing with other plugins' files with the same names.

## Registering CSS files

To register a CSS file with the asset system, use the `FilamentAsset::register()` method in the `boot()` method of a service provider. You must pass in an array of `Css` objects, which each represents a CSS file that should be registered in the asset system.

Each `Css` object has a unique ID and a path to the CSS file:

```php
use Filament\Support\Assets\Css;
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentAsset;

FilamentAsset::register([
    Css::make('custom-stylesheet', __DIR__ . '/../../resources/css/custom.css'),
]);
```

In this example, we use `__DIR__` to generate a relative path to the asset from the current file. For instance, if you were adding this code to `/app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php`, then the CSS file should exist in `/resources/css/custom.css`.

Now, when the `php artisan filament:assets` command is run, this CSS file is copied into the `/public` directory. In addition, it is now loaded into all Blade views that use Filament. If you're interested in only loading the CSS when it is required by an element on the page, check out the [Lazy loading CSS](#lazy-loading-css) section.

### Using Tailwind CSS in plugins

Typically, registering CSS files is used to register custom stylesheets for your application. If you want to process these files using Tailwind CSS, you need to consider the implications of that, especially if you are a plugin developer.

Tailwind builds are unique to every application - they contain a minimal set of utility classes, only the ones that you are actually using in your application. This means that if you are a plugin developer, you probably should not be building your Tailwind CSS files into your plugin. Instead, you should provide the raw CSS files and instruct the user that they should build the Tailwind CSS file themselves. To do this, they probably just need to add your vendor directory into the `content` array of their `tailwind.config.js` file:

```js
export default {
    content: [
        './resources/**/*.blade.php',
        './vendor/filament/**/*.blade.php',
        './vendor/danharrin/filament-blog/resources/views/**/*.blade.php', // Your plugin's vendor directory
    ],
    // ...
}
```

This means that when they build their Tailwind CSS file, it will include all the utility classes that are used in your plugin's views, as well as the utility classes that are used in their application and the Filament core.

However, with this technique, there might be extra complications for users who use your plugin with the [Panel Builder](../panels). If they have a [custom theme](../panels/themes), they will be fine, since they are building their own CSS file anyway using Tailwind CSS. However, if they are using the default stylesheet which is shipped with the Panel Builder, you might have to be careful about the utility classes that you use in your plugin's views. For instance, if you use a utility class that is not included in the default stylesheet, the user is not compiling it themselves, and it will not be included in the final CSS file. This means that your plugin's views might not look as expected. This is one of the few situations where I would recommend compiling and [registering](#registering-css-files) a Tailwind CSS-compiled stylesheet in your plugin.

### Lazy loading CSS

By default, all CSS files registered with the asset system are loaded in the `<head>` of every Filament page. This is the simplest way to load CSS files, but sometimes they may be quite heavy and not required on every page. In this case, you can leverage the [Alpine.js Lazy Load Assets](https://github.com/tanthammar/alpine-lazy-load-assets) package that comes bundled with Filament. It allows you to easily load CSS files on-demand using Alpine.js. The premise is very simple, you use the `x-load-css` directive on an element, and when that element is loaded onto the page, the specified CSS files are loaded into the `<head>` of the page. This is perfect for both small UI elements and entire pages that require a CSS file:

```blade
<div
    x-data="{}"
    x-load-css="[@js(\Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentAsset::getStyleHref('custom-stylesheet'))]"
>
    <!-- ... -->
</div>
```

To prevent the CSS file from being loaded automatically, you can use the `loadedOnRequest()` method:

```php
use Filament\Support\Assets\Css;
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentAsset;

FilamentAsset::register([
    Css::make('custom-stylesheet', __DIR__ . '/../../resources/css/custom.css')->loadedOnRequest(),
]);
```

If your CSS file was [registered to a plugin](#registering-assets-for-a-plugin), you must pass that in as the second argument to the `FilamentAsset::getStyleHref()` method:

```blade
<div
    x-data="{}"
    x-load-css="[@js(\Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentAsset::getStyleHref('custom-stylesheet', package: 'danharrin/filament-blog'))]"
>
    <!-- ... -->
</div>
```

### Registering CSS files from a URL

If you want to register a CSS file from a URL, you may do so. These assets will be loaded on every page as normal, but not copied into the `/public` directory when the `php artisan filament:assets` command is run. This is useful for registering external stylesheets from a CDN, or stylesheets that you are already compiling directly into the `/public` directory:

```php
use Filament\Support\Assets\Css;
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentAsset;

FilamentAsset::register([
    Css::make('example-external-stylesheet', 'https://example.com/external.css'),
    Css::make('example-local-stylesheet', asset('css/local.css')),
]);
```

### Registering CSS variables

Sometimes, you may wish to use dynamic data from the backend in CSS files. To do this, you can use the `FilamentAsset::registerCssVariables()` method in the `boot()` method of a service provider:

```php
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentAsset;

FilamentAsset::registerCssVariables([
    'background-image' => asset('images/background.jpg'),
]);
```

Now, you can access these variables from any CSS file:

```css
background-image: var(--background-image);
```

## Registering JavaScript files

To register a JavaScript file with the asset system, use the `FilamentAsset::register()` method in the `boot()` method of a service provider. You must pass in an array of `Js` objects, which each represents a JavaScript file that should be registered in the asset system.

Each `Js` object has a unique ID and a path to the JavaScript file:

```php
use Filament\Support\Assets\Js;

FilamentAsset::register([
    Js::make('custom-script', __DIR__ . '/../../resources/js/custom.js'),
]);
```

In this example, we use `__DIR__` to generate a relative path to the asset from the current file. For instance, if you were adding this code to `/app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php`, then the JavaScript file should exist in `/resources/js/custom.js`.

Now, when the `php artisan filament:assets` command is run, this JavaScript file is copied into the `/public` directory. In addition, it is now loaded into all Blade views that use Filament. If you're interested in only loading the JavaScript when it is required by an element on the page, check out the [Lazy loading JavaScript](#lazy-loading-javascript) section.

### Lazy loading JavaScript

By default, all JavaScript files registered with the asset system are loaded at the bottom of every Filament page. This is the simplest way to load JavaScript files, but sometimes they may be quite heavy and not required on every page. In this case, you can leverage the [Alpine.js Lazy Load Assets](https://github.com/tanthammar/alpine-lazy-load-assets) package that comes bundled with Filament. It allows you to easily load JavaScript files on-demand using Alpine.js. The premise is very simple, you use the `x-load-js` directive on an element, and when that element is loaded onto the page, the specified JavaScript files are loaded at the bottom of the page. This is perfect for both small UI elements and entire pages that require a JavaScript file:

```blade
<div
    x-data="{}"
    x-load-js="[@js(\Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentAsset::getScriptSrc('custom-script'))]"
>
    <!-- ... -->
</div>
```

To prevent the JavaScript file from being loaded automatically, you can use the `loadedOnRequest()` method:

```php
use Filament\Support\Assets\Js;
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentAsset;

FilamentAsset::register([
    Js::make('custom-script', __DIR__ . '/../../resources/js/custom.js')->loadedOnRequest(),
]);
```

If your JavaScript file was [registered to a plugin](#registering-assets-for-a-plugin), you must pass that in as the second argument to the `FilamentAsset::getScriptSrc()` method:

```blade
<div
    x-data="{}"
    x-load-js="[@js(\Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentAsset::getScriptSrc('custom-script', package: 'danharrin/filament-blog'))]"
>
    <!-- ... -->
</div>
```

#### Asynchronous Alpine.js components

<LaracastsBanner
    title="Using Async Alpine components"
    description="Watch the Build Advanced Components for Filament series on Laracasts - it will teach you how to get started with Async Alpine components into a plugin."
    url="https://laracasts.com/series/build-advanced-components-for-filament/episodes/15"
    series="building-advanced-components"
/>

Sometimes, you may want to load external JavaScript libraries for your Alpine.js-based components. The best way to do this is by storing the compiled JavaScript and Alpine component in a separate file, and letting us load it whenever the component is rendered.

Firstly, you should install [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io) via NPM, which we will use to create a single JavaScript file containing your external library and Alpine component:

```bash
npm install esbuild --save-dev
```

Then, you must create a script to compile your JavaScript and Alpine component. You can put this anywhere, for example `bin/build.js`:

```js
import * as esbuild from 'esbuild'

const isDev = process.argv.includes('--dev')

async function compile(options) {
    const context = await esbuild.context(options)

    if (isDev) {
        await context.watch()
    } else {
        await context.rebuild()
        await context.dispose()
    }
}

const defaultOptions = {
    define: {
        'process.env.NODE_ENV': isDev ? `'development'` : `'production'`,
    },
    bundle: true,
    mainFields: ['module', 'main'],
    platform: 'neutral',
    sourcemap: isDev ? 'inline' : false,
    sourcesContent: isDev,
    treeShaking: true,
    target: ['es2020'],
    minify: !isDev,
    plugins: [{
        name: 'watchPlugin',
        setup: function (build) {
            build.onStart(() => {
                console.log(`Build started at ${new Date(Date.now()).toLocaleTimeString()}: ${build.initialOptions.outfile}`)
            })

            build.onEnd((result) => {
                if (result.errors.length > 0) {
                    console.log(`Build failed at ${new Date(Date.now()).toLocaleTimeString()}: ${build.initialOptions.outfile}`, result.errors)
                } else {
                    console.log(`Build finished at ${new Date(Date.now()).toLocaleTimeString()}: ${build.initialOptions.outfile}`)
                }
            })
        }
    }],
}

compile({
    ...defaultOptions,
    entryPoints: ['./resources/js/components/test-component.js'],
    outfile: './resources/js/dist/components/test-component.js',
})
```

As you can see at the bottom of the script, we are compiling a file called `resources/js/components/test-component.js` into `resources/js/dist/components/test-component.js`. You can change these paths to suit your needs. You can compile as many components as you want.

Now, create a new file called `resources/js/components/test-component.js`:

```js
// Import any external JavaScript libraries from NPM here.

export default function testComponent({
    state,
}) {
    return {
        state,
        
        // You can define any other Alpine.js properties here.

        init: function () {
            // Initialise the Alpine component here, if you need to.
        },
        
        // You can define any other Alpine.js functions here.
    }
}
```

Now, you can compile this file into `resources/js/dist/components/test-component.js` by running the following command:

```bash
node bin/build.js
```

If you want to watch for changes to this file instead of compiling once, try the following command:

```bash
node bin/build.js --dev
```

Now, you need to tell Filament to publish this compiled JavaScript file into the `/public` directory of the Laravel application, so it is accessible to the browser. To do this, you can use the `FilamentAsset::register()` method in the `boot()` method of a service provider, passing in an `AlpineComponent` object:

```php
use Filament\Support\Assets\AlpineComponent;
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentAsset;

FilamentAsset::register([
    AlpineComponent::make('test-component', __DIR__ . '/../../resources/js/dist/components/test-component.js'),
]);
```

When you run `php artisan filament:assets`, the compiled file will be copied into the `/public` directory.

Finally, you can load this asynchronous Alpine component in your view using `x-load` attributes and the `FilamentAsset::getAlpineComponentSrc()` method:

```blade
<div
    x-load
    x-load-src="{{ \Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentAsset::getAlpineComponentSrc('test-component') }}"
    x-data="testComponent({
        state: $wire.{{ $applyStateBindingModifiers("\$entangle('{$statePath}')") }},
    })"
>
    <input x-model="state" />
</div>
```

This example is for a [custom form field](../forms/fields/custom). It passes the `state` in as a parameter to the `testComponent()` function, which is entangled with a Livewire component property. You can pass in any parameters you want, and access them in the `testComponent()` function. If you're not using a custom form field, you can ignore the `state` parameter in this example.

The `x-load` attributes come from the [Async Alpine](https://async-alpine.dev/docs/strategies) package, and any features of that package can be used here.

### Registering script data

Sometimes, you may wish to make data from the backend available to JavaScript files. To do this, you can use the `FilamentAsset::registerScriptData()` method in the `boot()` method of a service provider:

```php
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentAsset;

FilamentAsset::registerScriptData([
    'user' => [
        'name' => auth()->user()?->name,
    ],
]);
```

Now, you can access that data from any JavaScript file at runtime, using the `window.filamentData` object:

```js
window.filamentData.user.name // 'Dan Harrin'
```

### Registering JavaScript files from a URL

If you want to register a JavaScript file from a URL, you may do so. These assets will be loaded on every page as normal, but not copied into the `/public` directory when the `php artisan filament:assets` command is run. This is useful for registering external scripts from a CDN, or scripts that you are already compiling directly into the `/public` directory:

```php
use Filament\Support\Assets\Js;

FilamentAsset::register([
    Js::make('example-external-script', 'https://example.com/external.js'),
    Js::make('example-local-script', asset('js/local.js')),
]);
```

# Documentation for support. File: 03-icons.md
---
title: Icons
---

## Overview

Icons are used throughout the entire Filament UI to visually communicate core parts of the user experience. To render icons, we use the [Blade Icons](https://github.com/blade-ui-kit/blade-icons) package from Blade UI Kit.

They have a website where you can [search all the available icons](https://blade-ui-kit.com/blade-icons?set=1#search) from various Blade Icons packages. Each package contains a different icon set that you can choose from.

## Using custom SVGs as icons

The [Blade Icons](https://github.com/blade-ui-kit/blade-icons) package allows you to register custom SVGs as icons. This is useful if you want to use your own custom icons in Filament.

To start with, publish the Blade Icons configuration file:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=blade-icons
```

Now, open the `config/blade-icons.php` file, and uncomment the `default` set in the `sets` array.

Now that the default set exists in the config file, you can simply put any icons you want inside the `resources/svg` directory of your application. For example, if you put an SVG file named `star.svg` inside the `resources/svg` directory, you can reference it anywhere in Filament as `icon-star`. The `icon-` prefix is configurable in the `config/blade-icons.php` file too. You can also render the custom icon in a Blade view using the [`@svg('icon-star')` directive](https://github.com/blade-ui-kit/blade-icons#directive).

## Replacing the default icons

Filament includes an icon management system that allows you to replace any icons that are used by default in the UI with your own. This happens in the `boot()` method of any service provider, like `AppServiceProvider`, or even a dedicated service provider for icons. If you wanted to build a plugin to replace Heroicons with a different set, you could absolutely do that by creating a Laravel package with a similar service provider.

To replace an icon, you can use the `FilamentIcon` facade. It has a `register()` method, which accepts an array of icons to replace. The key of the array is the unique [icon alias](#available-icon-aliases) that identifies the icon in the Filament UI, and the value is name of a Blade icon to replace it instead. Alternatively, you may use HTML instead of an icon name to render an icon from a Blade view for example:

```php
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentIcon;

FilamentIcon::register([
    'panels::topbar.global-search.field' => 'fas-magnifying-glass',
    'panels::sidebar.group.collapse-button' => view('icons.chevron-up'),
]);
```

### Allowing users to customize icons from your plugin

If you have built a Filament plugin, your users may want to be able to customize icons in the same way that they can with any core Filament package. This is possible if you replace any manual `@svg()` usages with the `<x-filament::icon>` Blade component. This component allows you to pass in an icon alias, the name of the SVG icon that should be used by default, and any classes or HTML attributes:

```blade
<x-filament::icon
    alias="panels::topbar.global-search.field"
    icon="heroicon-m-magnifying-glass"
    wire:target="search"
    class="h-5 w-5 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400"
/>
```

Alternatively, you may pass an SVG element into the component's slot instead of defining a default icon name:

```blade
<x-filament::icon
    alias="panels::topbar.global-search.field"
    wire:target="search"
    class="h-5 w-5 text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400"
>
    <svg>
        <!-- ... -->
    </svg>
</x-filament::icon>
```

## Available icon aliases

title: Colors

## Overview

Filament uses CSS variables to define its color palette. These CSS variables are mapped to Tailwind classes in the preset file that you load when installing Filament.

## Customizing the default colors

From a service provider's `boot()` method, or middleware, you can call the `FilamentColor::register()` method, which you can use to customize which colors Filament uses for UI elements.

There are 6 default colors that are used throughout Filament that you are able to customize:

```php
use Filament\Support\Colors\Color;
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentColor;

FilamentColor::register([
    'danger' => Color::Red,
    'gray' => Color::Zinc,
    'info' => Color::Blue,
    'primary' => Color::Amber,
    'success' => Color::Green,
    'warning' => Color::Amber,
]);
```

The `Color` class contains every [Tailwind CSS color](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors#color-palette-reference) to choose from.

You can also pass in a function to `register()` which will only get called when the app is getting rendered. This is useful if you are calling `register()` from a service provider, and want to access objects like the currently authenticated user, which are initialized later in middleware.

## Using a non-Tailwind color

You can use custom colors that are not included in the [Tailwind CSS color](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors#color-palette-reference) palette by passing an array of color shades from `50` to `950` in RGB format:

```php
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentColor;

FilamentColor::register([
    'danger' => [
        50 => '254, 242, 242',
        100 => '254, 226, 226',
        200 => '254, 202, 202',
        300 => '252, 165, 165',
        400 => '248, 113, 113',
        500 => '239, 68, 68',
        600 => '220, 38, 38',
        700 => '185, 28, 28',
        800 => '153, 27, 27',
        900 => '127, 29, 29',
        950 => '69, 10, 10',
    ],
]);
```

### Generating a custom color from a hex code

You can use the `Color::hex()` method to generate a custom color palette from a hex code:

```php
use Filament\Support\Colors\Color;
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentColor;

FilamentColor::register([
    'danger' => Color::hex('#ff0000'),
]);
```

### Generating a custom color from an RGB value

You can use the `Color::rgb()` method to generate a custom color palette from an RGB value:

```php
use Filament\Support\Colors\Color;
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentColor;

FilamentColor::register([
    'danger' => Color::rgb('rgb(255, 0, 0)'),
]);
```

## Registering extra colors

You can register extra colors that you can use throughout Filament:

```php
use Filament\Support\Colors\Color;
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentColor;

FilamentColor::register([
    'indigo' => Color::Indigo,
]);
```

Now, you can use this color anywhere you would normally add `primary`, `danger`, etc.

## Overview

Filament uses CSS "hook" classes to allow various HTML elements to be customized using CSS.

## Discovering hook classes

We could document all the hook classes across the entire Filament UI, but that would be a lot of work, and probably not very useful to you. Instead, we recommend using your browser's developer tools to inspect the elements you want to customize, and then use the hook classes to target those elements.

All hook classes are prefixed with `fi-`, which is a great way to identify them. They are usually right at the start of the class list, so they are easy to find, but sometimes they may fall further down the list if we have to apply them conditionally with JavaScript or Blade.

If you don't find a hook class you're looking for, try not to hack around it, as it might expose your styling customizations to breaking changes in future releases. Instead, please open a pull request to add the hook class you need. We can help you maintain naming consistency. You probably don't even need to pull down the Filament repository locally for these pull requests, as you can just edit the Blade files directly on GitHub.

## Applying styles to hook classes

For example, if you want to customize the color of the sidebar, you can inspect the sidebar element in your browser's developer tools, see that it uses the `fi-sidebar`, and then add CSS to your app like this:

```css
.fi-sidebar {
    background-color: #fafafa;
}
```

Alternatively, since Filament is built upon Tailwind CSS, you can use their `@apply` directive to apply Tailwind classes to Filament elements:

```css
.fi-sidebar {
    @apply bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-950;
}
```

Occasionally, you may need to use the `!important` modifier to override existing styles, but please use this sparingly, as it can make your styles difficult to maintain:

```css
.fi-sidebar {
    @apply bg-gray-50 dark:bg-gray-950 !important;
}
```

You can even apply `!important` to only specific Tailwind classes, which is a little less intrusive, by prefixing the class name with `!`:

```css
.fi-sidebar {
    @apply !bg-gray-50 dark:!bg-gray-950;
}
```

## Common hook class abbreviations

We use a few common abbreviations in our hook classes to keep them short and readable:

- `fi` is short for "Filament"
- `fi-ac` is used to represent classes used in the Actions package
- `fi-fo` is used to represent classes used in the Form Builder package
- `fi-in` is used to represent classes used in the Infolist Builder package
- `fi-no` is used to represent classes used in the Notifications package
- `fi-ta` is used to represent classes used in the Table Builder package
- `fi-wi` is used to represent classes used in the Widgets package
- `btn` is short for "button"
- `col` is short for "column"
- `ctn` is short for "container"
- `wrp` is short for "wrapper"

## Publishing Blade views

You may be tempted to publish the internal Blade views to your application so that you can customize them. We don't recommend this, as it will introduce breaking changes into your application in future updates. Please use the [CSS hook classes](#applying-styles-to-hook-classes) wherever possible.

If you do decide to publish the Blade views, please lock all Filament packages to a specific version in your `composer.json` file, and then update Filament manually by bumping this number, testing your entire application after each update. This will help you identify breaking changes safely.

# Documentation for support. File: 06-render-hooks.md
---
title: Render hooks
---

## Overview

Filament allows you to render Blade content at various points in the frameworks views. It's useful for plugins to be able to inject HTML into the framework. Also, since Filament does not recommend publishing the views due to an increased risk of breaking changes, it's also useful for users.

## Registering render hooks

To register render hooks, you can call `FilamentView::registerRenderHook()` from a service provider or middleware. The first argument is the name of the render hook, and the second argument is a callback that returns the content to be rendered:

```php
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentView;
use Filament\View\PanelsRenderHook;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Blade;

FilamentView::registerRenderHook(
    PanelsRenderHook::BODY_START,
    fn (): string => Blade::render('@livewire(\'livewire-ui-modal\')'),
);
```

You could also render view content from a file:

```php
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentView;
use Filament\View\PanelsRenderHook;
use Illuminate\Contracts\View\View;

FilamentView::registerRenderHook(
    PanelsRenderHook::BODY_START,
    fn (): View => view('impersonation-banner'),
);
```

- `TablesRenderHook::TOOLBAR_REORDER_TRIGGER_AFTER` - After the [reorder](../tables/advanced#reordering-records) trigger
- `TablesRenderHook::TOOLBAR_REORDER_TRIGGER_BEFORE` - Before the [reorder](../tables/advanced#reordering-records) trigger
- `TablesRenderHook::TOOLBAR_SEARCH_AFTER` - After the [search](../tables/getting-started#making-columns-sortable-and-searchable) container
- `TablesRenderHook::TOOLBAR_SEARCH_BEFORE` - Before the [search](../tables/getting-started#making-columns-sortable-and-searchable) container
- `TablesRenderHook::TOOLBAR_START` - The start of the toolbar
- `TablesRenderHook::TOOLBAR_TOGGLE_COLUMN_TRIGGER_AFTER` - After the [toggle columns](../tables/columns/getting-started#toggling-column-visibility) trigger
- `TablesRenderHook::TOOLBAR_TOGGLE_COLUMN_TRIGGER_BEFORE` - Before the [toggle columns](../tables/columns/getting-started#toggling-column-visibility) trigger


### Widgets render hooks

```php
    use Filament\Widgets\View\WidgetsRenderHook;
```

- `WidgetsRenderHook::TABLE_WIDGET_END` - End of the [table widget](../panels/dashboard#table-widgets), after the table itself, also [can be scoped](#scoping-render-hooks) to the table widget class
- `WidgetsRenderHook::TABLE_WIDGET_START` - Start of the [table widget](../panels/dashboard#table-widgets), before the table itself, also [can be scoped](#scoping-render-hooks) to the table widget class


## Scoping render hooks

Some render hooks can be given a "scope", which allows them to only be output on a specific page or Livewire component. For instance, you might want to register a render hook for just 1 page. To do that, you can pass the class of the page or component as the second argument to `registerRenderHook()`:

```php
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentView;
use Filament\View\PanelsRenderHook;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Blade;

FilamentView::registerRenderHook(
    PanelsRenderHook::PAGE_START,
    fn (): View => view('warning-banner'),
    scopes: \App\Filament\Resources\UserResource\Pages\EditUser::class,
);
```

You can also pass an array of scopes to register the render hook for:

```php
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentView;
use Filament\View\PanelsRenderHook;

FilamentView::registerRenderHook(
    PanelsRenderHook::PAGE_START,
    fn (): View => view('warning-banner'),
    scopes: [
        \App\Filament\Resources\UserResource\Pages\CreateUser::class,
        \App\Filament\Resources\UserResource\Pages\EditUser::class,
    ],
);
```

Some render hooks for the [Panel Builder](#panel-builder-render-hooks) allow you to scope hooks to all pages in a resource:

```php
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentView;
use Filament\View\PanelsRenderHook;

FilamentView::registerRenderHook(
    PanelsRenderHook::PAGE_START,
    fn (): View => view('warning-banner'),
    scopes: \App\Filament\Resources\UserResource::class,
);
```

### Retrieving the currently active scopes inside the render hook

The `$scopes` are passed to the render hook function, and you can use them to determine which page or component the render hook is being rendered on:

```php
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentView;
use Filament\View\PanelsRenderHook;

FilamentView::registerRenderHook(
    PanelsRenderHook::PAGE_START,
    fn (array $scopes): View => view('warning-banner', ['scopes' => $scopes]),
    scopes: \App\Filament\Resources\UserResource::class,
);
```

## Rendering hooks

Plugin developers might find it useful to expose render hooks to their users. You do not need to register them anywhere, simply output them in Blade like so:

```blade
{{ \Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentView::renderHook(\Filament\View\PanelsRenderHook::PAGE_START) }}
```

To provide scope your render hook, you can pass it as the second argument to `renderHook()`. For instance, if your hook is inside a Livewire component, you can pass the class of the component using `static::class`:

```blade
{{ \Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentView::renderHook(\Filament\View\PanelsRenderHook::PAGE_START, scopes: $this->getRenderHookScopes()) }}
```

You can even pass multiple scopes as an array, and all render hooks that match any of the scopes will be rendered:

```blade
{{ \Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentView::renderHook(\Filament\View\PanelsRenderHook::PAGE_START, scopes: [static::class, \App\Filament\Resources\UserResource::class]) }}
```

title: Enums
---

## Overview

Enums are special PHP classes that represent a fixed set of constants. They are useful for modeling concepts that have a limited number of possible values, like days of the week, months in a year, or the suits in a deck of cards.

Since enum "cases" are instances of the enum class, adding interfaces to enums proves to be very useful. Filament provides a collection of interfaces that you can add to enums, which enhance your experience when working with them.

> When using an enum with an attribute on your Eloquent model, please [ensure that it is cast correctly](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-mutators#enum-casting).

## Enum labels

The `HasLabel` interface transforms an enum instance into a textual label. This is useful for displaying human-readable enum values in your UI.

```php
use Filament\Support\Contracts\HasLabel;

enum Status: string implements HasLabel
{
    case Draft = 'draft';
    case Reviewing = 'reviewing';
    case Published = 'published';
    case Rejected = 'rejected';
    
    public function getLabel(): ?string
    {
        return $this->name;
        
        // or
    
        return match ($this) {
            self::Draft => 'Draft',
            self::Reviewing => 'Reviewing',
            self::Published => 'Published',
            self::Rejected => 'Rejected',
        };
    }
}
```

### Using the enum label with form field options

The `HasLabel` interface can be used to generate an array of options from an enum, where the enum's value is the key and the enum's label is the value. This applies to Form Builder fields like [`Select`](../forms/fields/select) and [`CheckboxList`](../forms/fields/checkbox-list), as well as the Table Builder's [`SelectColumn`](../tables/columns/select) and [`SelectFilter`](../tables/filters/select):

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\CheckboxList;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Radio;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Select;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\SelectColumn;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\SelectFilter;

Select::make('status')
    ->options(Status::class)

CheckboxList::make('status')
    ->options(Status::class)

Radio::make('status')
    ->options(Status::class)

SelectColumn::make('status')
    ->options(Status::class)

SelectFilter::make('status')
    ->options(Status::class)
```

In these examples, `Status::class` is the enum class which implements `HasLabel`, and the options are generated from that:

```php
[
    'draft' => 'Draft',
    'reviewing' => 'Reviewing',
    'published' => 'Published',
    'rejected' => 'Rejected',
]
```

### Using the enum label with a text column in your table

If you use a [`TextColumn`](../tables/columns/text) with the Table Builder, and it is cast to an enum in your Eloquent model, Filament will automatically use the `HasLabel` interface to display the enum's label instead of its raw value.

### Using the enum label as a group title in your table

If you use a [grouping](../tables/grouping) with the Table Builder, and it is cast to an enum in your Eloquent model, Filament will automatically use the `HasLabel` interface to display the enum's label instead of its raw value. The label will be displayed as the [title of each group](../tables/grouping#setting-a-group-title).

### Using the enum label with a text entry in your infolist

If you use a [`TextEntry`](../infolists/entries/text) with the Infolist Builder, and it is cast to an enum in your Eloquent model, Filament will automatically use the `HasLabel` interface to display the enum's label instead of its raw value.

## Enum colors

The `HasColor` interface transforms an enum instance into a [color](colors). This is useful for displaying colored enum values in your UI.

```php
use Filament\Support\Contracts\HasColor;

enum Status: string implements HasColor
{
    case Draft = 'draft';
    case Reviewing = 'reviewing';
    case Published = 'published';
    case Rejected = 'rejected';
    
    public function getColor(): string | array | null
    {
        return match ($this) {
            self::Draft => 'gray',
            self::Reviewing => 'warning',
            self::Published => 'success',
            self::Rejected => 'danger',
        };
    }
}
```

### Using the enum color with a text column in your table

If you use a [`TextColumn`](../tables/columns/text) with the Table Builder, and it is cast to an enum in your Eloquent model, Filament will automatically use the `HasColor` interface to display the enum label in its color. This works best if you use the [`badge()`](../tables/columns/text#displaying-as-a-badge) method on the column.

### Using the enum color with a text entry in your infolist

If you use a [`TextEntry`](../infolists/entries/text) with the Infolist Builder, and it is cast to an enum in your Eloquent model, Filament will automatically use the `HasColor` interface to display the enum label in its color. This works best if you use the [`badge()`](../infolists/entries/text#displaying-as-a-badge) method on the entry.

### Using the enum color with a toggle buttons field in your form

If you use a [`ToggleButtons`](../forms/fields/toggle-buttons) with the Form Builder, and it is set to use an enum for its options, Filament will automatically use the `HasColor` interface to display the enum label in its color.

## Enum icons

The `HasIcon` interface transforms an enum instance into an [icon](icons). This is useful for displaying icons alongside enum values in your UI.

```php
use Filament\Support\Contracts\HasIcon;

enum Status: string implements HasIcon
{
    case Draft = 'draft';
    case Reviewing = 'reviewing';
    case Published = 'published';
    case Rejected = 'rejected';
    
    public function getIcon(): ?string
    {
        return match ($this) {
            self::Draft => 'heroicon-m-pencil',
            self::Reviewing => 'heroicon-m-eye',
            self::Published => 'heroicon-m-check',
            self::Rejected => 'heroicon-m-x-mark',
        };
    }
}
```

### Using the enum icon with a text column in your table

If you use a [`TextColumn`](../tables/columns/text) with the Table Builder, and it is cast to an enum in your Eloquent model, Filament will automatically use the `HasIcon` interface to display the enum's icon aside its label. This works best if you use the [`badge()`](../tables/columns/text#displaying-as-a-badge) method on the column.

### Using the enum icon with a text entry in your infolist

If you use a [`TextEntry`](../infolists/entries/text) with the Infolist Builder, and it is cast to an enum in your Eloquent model, Filament will automatically use the `HasIcon` interface to display the enum's icon aside its label. This works best if you use the [`badge()`](../infolists/entries/text#displaying-as-a-badge) method on the entry.

### Using the enum icon with a toggle buttons field in your form

If you use a [`ToggleButtons`](../forms/fields/toggle-buttons) with the Form Builder, and it is set to use an enum for its options, Filament will automatically use the `HasIcon` interface to display the enum's icon aside its label.

## Enum descriptions

The `HasDescription` interface transforms an enum instance into a textual description, often displayed under its [label](#enum-labels). This is useful for displaying human-friendly descriptions in your UI.

```php
use Filament\Support\Contracts\HasDescription;
use Filament\Support\Contracts\HasLabel;

enum Status: string implements HasLabel, HasDescription
{
    case Draft = 'draft';
    case Reviewing = 'reviewing';
    case Published = 'published';
    case Rejected = 'rejected';
    
    public function getLabel(): ?string
    {
        return $this->name;
    }
    
    public function getDescription(): ?string
    {
        return match ($this) {
            self::Draft => 'This has not finished being written yet.',
            self::Reviewing => 'This is ready for a staff member to read.',
            self::Published => 'This has been approved by a staff member and is public on the website.',
            self::Rejected => 'A staff member has decided this is not appropriate for the website.',
        };
    }
}
```

### Using the enum description with form field descriptions

The `HasDescription` interface can be used to generate an array of descriptions from an enum, where the enum's value is the key and the enum's description is the value. This applies to Form Builder fields like [`Radio`](../forms/fields/radio#setting-option-descriptions) and [`CheckboxList`](../forms/fields/checkbox-list#setting-option-descriptions):

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\CheckboxList;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Radio;

Radio::make('status')
    ->options(Status::class)

CheckboxList::make('status')
    ->options(Status::class)
```

> Parts of this guide are taken from [Laravel's contribution guide](https://laravel.com/docs/contributions), and it served as very useful inspiration.

## Reporting bugs

If you find a bug in Filament, please report it by opening an issue on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/filamentphp/filament/issues/new/choose). Before opening an issue, please search the [existing issues](https://github.com/filamentphp/filament/issues?q=is%3Aissue) to see if the bug has already been reported.

Please make sure to include as much information as possible, including the version of packages in your app. You can use this Artisan command in your app to open a new issue with all the correct versions pre-filled:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-issue
```

When creating an issue, we require a "reproduction repository". **Please do not link to your actual project**, what we need instead is a _minimal_ reproduction in a fresh project without any unnecessary code. This means it doesn't matter if your real project is private / confidential, since we want a link to a separate, isolated reproduction. This allows us to fix the problem much quicker. **Issues will be automatically closed and not reviewed if this is missing, to preserve maintainer time and to ensure the process is fair for those who put effort into reporting.** If you believe a reproduction repository is not suitable for the issue, which is a very rare case, please `@danharrin` and explain why. Saying that "it's just a simple issue" is not an excuse for not creating a repository! [Need a headstart? We have a template Filament project for you.](https://filament-issue.unitedbycode.com)

Remember, bug reports are created in the hope that others with the same problem will be able to collaborate with you on solving it. Do not expect that the bug report will automatically see any activity or that others will jump to fix it. Creating a bug report serves to help yourself and others start on the path of fixing the problem.

## Development of new features

If you would like to propose a new feature or improvement to Filament, you may use our [discussion form](https://github.com/filamentphp/filament/discussions) hosted on GitHub. If you are intending on implementing the feature yourself in a pull request, we advise you to `@danharrin` in your feature discussion beforehand and ask if it is suitable for the framework to prevent wasting your time.

## Development of plugins

If you would like to develop a plugin for Filament, please refer to the [plugin development section](https://filamentphp.com/docs/support/plugins) here in the documentation. Our [Discord](https://filamentphp.com/discord) server is also a great place to ask questions and get help with plugin development. You can start a conversation in the [`#plugin-developers-chat`](https://discord.com/channels/883083792112300104/970354547723730955) channel.

You can [submit your plugin to the Filament website](https://github.com/filamentphp/filamentphp.com/blob/main/README.md#contributing).

## Developing with a local copy of Filament

If you want to contribute to the Filament packages, then you may want to test it in a real Laravel project:

- Fork [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/filamentphp/filament) to your GitHub account.
- Create a Laravel app locally.
- Clone your fork in your Laravel app's root directory.
- In the `/filament` directory, create a branch for your fix, e.g. `fix/error-message`.

Install the packages in your app's `composer.json`:

```jsonc
{
    // ...
    "require": {
        "filament/filament": "*",
    },
    "minimum-stability": "dev",
    "repositories": [
        {
            "type": "path",
            "url": "filament/packages/*"
        }
    ],
    // ...
}
```

Now, run `composer update`.

Once you're finished making changes, you can commit them and submit a pull request to [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/filamentphp/filament).

## Checking for missing translations

Set up a Laravel app, and install the [panel builder](https://filamentphp.com/docs/admin/installation).

Now, if you want to check for missing Spanish translations, run:

```bash
php artisan filament:check-translations es
```

This will let you know which translations are missing for this locale. You can make a pull request with the changes to [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/filamentphp/filament).

If you've published the translations into your app and you'd like to check those instead, try:

```bash
php artisan filament:check-translations es --source=app
```

## Security vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability within Filament, please email Dan Harrin via [dan@danharrin.com](mailto:dan@danharrin.com). All security vulnerabilities will be promptly addressed.

## Code of Conduct

Please note that Filament is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](https://github.com/filamentphp/filament/blob/afa0c703da18ce78b508951436f571c9d4813db6/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

## Overview

While Filament comes with virtually any tool you'll need to build great apps, sometimes you'll need to add your own functionality either for just your app or as redistributable packages that other developers can include in their own apps. This is why Filament offers a plugin system that allows you to extend its functionality.

Before we dive in, it's important to understand the different contexts in which plugins can be used. There are two main contexts:

1. **Panel Plugins**: These are plugins that are used with [Panel Builders](/docs/3.x/panels/installation). They are typically used only to add functionality when used inside a Panel or as a complete Panel in and of itself. Examples of this are:
   1. A plugin that adds specific functionality to the dashboard in the form of Widgets.
   2. A plugin that adds a set of Resources / functionality to an app like a Blog or User Management feature.
2. **Standalone Plugins**: These are plugins that are used in any context outside a Panel Builder. Examples of this are:
   1. A plugin that adds custom fields to be used with the [Form Builders](/docs/3.x/forms/installation/).
   2. A plugin that adds custom columns or filters to the [Table Builders](/docs/3.x/tables/installation/).

Although these are two different mental contexts to keep in mind when building plugins, they can be used together inside the same plugin. They do not have to be mutually exclusive.

## Important Concepts

Before we dive into the specifics of building plugins, there are a few concepts that are important to understand. You should familiarize yourself with the following before building a plugin:

1. [Laravel Package Development](https://laravel.com/docs/packages)
2. [Spatie Package Tools](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-package-tools)
3. [Filament Asset Management](/docs/3.x/support/assets)

### The Plugin object

Filament v3 introduces the concept of a Plugin object that is used to configure the plugin. This object is a simple PHP class that implements the `Filament\Contracts\Plugin` interface. This class is used to configure the plugin and is the main entry point for the plugin. It is also used to register Resources and Icons that might be used by your plugin.

While the plugin object is extremely helpful, it is not required to build a plugin. You can still build plugins without using the plugin object as you can see in the [Building a Panel Plugin](/docs/3.x/support/plugins/build-a-panel-plugin) tutorial.

> **Info** 
> The Plugin object is only used for Panel Providers. Standalone Plugins do not use this object. All configuration for Standalone Plugins should be handled in the plugin's service provider.

### Registering Assets

All [asset registration](/docs/3.x/support/assets), including CSS, JS and Alpine Components, should be done through the plugin's service provider in the `packageBooted()` method. This allows Filament to register the assets with the Asset Manager and load them when needed.

## Creating a Plugin

While you can certainly build plugins from scratch, we recommend using the [Filament Plugin Skeleton](https://github.com/filamentphp/plugin-skeleton) to quickly get started. This skeleton includes all the necessary boilerplate to get you up and running quickly.

### Usage

To use the skeleton, simply go to the GitHub repo and click the "Use this template" button. This will create a new repo in your account with the skeleton code. After that, you can clone the repo to your machine. Once you have the code on your machine, navigate to the root of the project and run the following command:

```bash
php ./configure.php
```

This will ask you a series of questions to configure the plugin. Once you've answered all the questions, the script will stub out a new plugin for you, and you can begin to build your amazing new extension for Filament.

## Upgrading existing plugins

Since every plugin varies greatly in its scope of use and functionality, there is no one size fits all approaches to upgrading existing plugins. However, one thing to note, that is consistent to all plugins is the deprecation of the `PluginServiceProvider`.

In your plugin service provider, you will need to change it to extend the PackageServiceProvider instead. You will also need to add a static `$name` property to the service provider. This property is used to register the plugin with Filament. Here is an example of what your service provider might look like:

```php
class MyPluginServiceProvider extends PackageServiceProvider
{
    public static string $name = 'my-plugin';

    public function configurePackage(Package $package): void
    {
        $package->name(static::$name);
    }
}
```

## Preface

Please read the docs on [panel plugin development](/docs/3.x/panels/plugins) and the [getting started guide](/docs/3.x/support/plugins/getting-started) before continuing.

## Overview

In this walkthrough, we'll build a simple plugin that adds a new form field that can be used in forms. This also means it will be available to users in their panels.

You can find the final code for this plugin at [https://github.com/awcodes/clock-widget](https://github.com/awcodes/clock-widget).

## Step 1: Create the plugin

First, we'll create the plugin using the steps outlined in the [getting started guide](/docs/3.x/support/plugins/getting-started#creating-a-plugin).

## Step 2: Clean up

Next, we'll clean up the plugin to remove the boilerplate code we don't need. This will seem like a lot, but since this is a simple plugin, we can remove a lot of the boilerplate code.

Remove the following directories and files:
1. `config`
1. `database`
1. `src/Commands`
1. `src/Facades`
1. `stubs`

Since our plugin doesn't have any settings or additional methods needed for functionality, we can also remove the `ClockWidgetPlugin.php` file.

1. `ClockWidgetPlugin.php`

Since Filament v3 recommends that users style their plugins with a custom filament theme, we'll remove the files needed for using css in the plugin. This is optional, and you can still use css if you want, but it is not recommended.

1. `resources/css`
1. `postcss.config.js`
1. `tailwind.config.js`

Now we can clean up our `composer.json` file to remove unneeded options.

```json
"autoload": {
    "psr-4": {
        // We can remove the database factories
        "Awcodes\\ClockWidget\\Database\\Factories\\": "database/factories/"
    }
},
"extra": {
    "laravel": {
        // We can remove the facade
        "aliases": {
            "ClockWidget": "Awcodes\\ClockWidget\\Facades\\ClockWidget"
        }
    }
},
```

The last step is to update the `package.json` file to remove unneeded options. Replace the contents of `package.json` with the following.

```json
{
    "private": true,
    "type": "module",
    "scripts": {
        "dev": "node bin/build.js --dev",
        "build": "node bin/build.js"
    },
    "devDependencies": {
        "esbuild": "^0.17.19"
    }
}
```

Then we need to install our dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

You may also remove the Testing directories and files, but we'll leave them in for now, although we won't be using them for this example, and we highly recommend that you write tests for your plugins.

## Step 3: Setting up the provider

Now that we have our plugin cleaned up, we can start adding our code. The boilerplate in the `src/ClockWidgetServiceProvider.php` file has a lot going on so, let's delete everything and start from scratch.

> In this example, we will be registering an [async Alpine component](../assets#asynchronous-alpinejs-components). Since these assets are only loaded on request, we can register them as normal in the `packageBooted()` method. If you are registering assets, like CSS or JS files, that get loaded on every page regardless of if they are used or not, you should register them in the `register()` method of the `Plugin` configuration object, using [`$panel->assets()`](../../panels/configuration#registering-assets-for-a-panel). Otherwise, if you register them in the `packageBooted()` method, they will be loaded in every panel, regardless of whether or not the plugin has been registered for that panel.

We need to be able to register our Widget with the panel and load our Alpine component when the widget is used. To do this, we'll need to add the following to the `packageBooted` method in our service provider. This will register our widget component with Livewire and our Alpine component with the Filament Asset Manager.

```php
use Filament\Support\Assets\AlpineComponent;
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentAsset;
use Livewire\Livewire;
use Spatie\LaravelPackageTools\Package;
use Spatie\LaravelPackageTools\PackageServiceProvider;

class ClockWidgetServiceProvider extends PackageServiceProvider
{
    public static string $name = 'clock-widget';

    public function configurePackage(Package $package): void
    {
        $package->name(static::$name)
            ->hasViews()
            ->hasTranslations();
    }

    public function packageBooted(): void
    {
        Livewire::component('clock-widget', ClockWidget::class);

        // Asset Registration
        FilamentAsset::register(
            assets:[
                 AlpineComponent::make('clock-widget', __DIR__ . '/../resources/dist/clock-widget.js'),
            ],
            package: 'awcodes/clock-widget'
        );
    }
}
```

## Step 4: Create the widget

Now we can create our widget. We'll first need to extend Filament's `Widget` class in our `ClockWidget.php` file and tell it where to find the view for the widget. Since we are using the PackageServiceProvider to register our views, we can use the `::` syntax to tell Filament where to find the view.

```php
use Filament\Widgets\Widget;

class ClockWidget extends Widget
{
    protected static string $view = 'clock-widget::widget';
}
```

Next, we'll need to create the view for our widget. Create a new file at `resources/views/widget.blade.php` and add the following code. We'll make use of Filament's blade components to save time on writing the html for the widget.

We are using async Alpine to load our Alpine component, so we'll need to add the `x-load` attribute to the div to tell Alpine to load our component. You can learn more about this in the [Core Concepts](/docs/3.x/support/assets#asynchronous-alpinejs-components) section of the docs.

```blade
<x-filament-widgets::widget>
    <x-filament::section>
        <x-slot name="heading">
            {{ __('clock-widget::clock-widget.title') }}
        </x-slot>

        <div
            x-load
            x-load-src="{{ \Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentAsset::getAlpineComponentSrc('clock-widget', 'awcodes/clock-widget') }}"
            x-data="clockWidget()"
            class="text-center"
        >
            <p>{{ __('clock-widget::clock-widget.description') }}</p>
            <p class="text-xl" x-text="time"></p>
        </div>
    </x-filament::section>
</x-filament-widgets::widget>
```

Next, we need to write our Alpine component in `src/js/index.js`. And build our assets with `npm run build`.

```js
export default function clockWidget() {
    return {
        time: new Date().toLocaleTimeString(),
        init() {
            setInterval(() => {
                this.time = new Date().toLocaleTimeString();
            }, 1000);
        }
    }
}
```

We should also add translations for the text in the widget so users can translate the widget into their language. We'll add the translations to `resources/lang/en/widget.php`.

```php
return [
    'title' => 'Clock Widget',
    'description' => 'Your current time is:',
];
```

## Step 5: Update your README

You'll want to update your `README.md` file to include instructions on how to install your plugin and any other information you want to share with users, Like how to use it in their projects. For example:

```php
// Register the plugin and/or Widget in your Panel provider:

use Awcodes\ClockWidget\ClockWidgetWidget;

public function panel(Panel $panel): Panel
{
    return $panel
        ->widgets([
            ClockWidgetWidget::class,
        ]);
}
```

And, that's it, our users can now install our plugin and use it in their projects.

title: Build a standalone plugin
---

## Preface

Please read the docs on [panel plugin development](/docs/3.x/panels/plugins/) and the [getting started guide](/docs/3.x/support/plugins/getting-started) before continuing.

## Overview

In this walkthrough, we'll build a simple plugin that adds a new form component that can be used in forms. This also means it will be available to users in their panels.

You can find the final code for this plugin at [https://github.com/awcodes/headings](https://github.com/awcodes/headings).

## Step 1: Create the plugin

First, we'll create the plugin using the steps outlined in the [getting started guide](/docs/3.x/support/plugins/getting-started#creating-a-plugin).

## Step 2: Clean up

Next, we'll clean up the plugin to remove the boilerplate code we don't need. This will seem like a lot, but since this is a simple plugin, we can remove a lot of the boilerplate code.

Remove the following directories and files:
1. `bin`
1. `config`
1. `database`
1. `src/Commands`
1. `src/Facades`
1. `stubs`
1. `tailwind.config.js`

Now we can clean up our `composer.json` file to remove unneeded options.

```json
"autoload": {
    "psr-4": {
        // We can remove the database factories
        "Awcodes\\Headings\\Database\\Factories\\": "database/factories/"
    }
},
"extra": {
    "laravel": {
        // We can remove the facade
        "aliases": {
            "Headings": "Awcodes\\Headings\\Facades\\ClockWidget"
        }
    }
},
```

Normally, Filament v3 recommends that users style their plugins with a custom filament theme, but for the sake of example let's provide our own stylesheet that can be loaded asynchronously using the new `x-load` features in Filament v3. So, let's update our `package.json` file to include cssnano, postcss, postcss-cli and postcss-nesting to build our stylesheet.

```json
{
    "private": true,
    "scripts": {
        "build": "postcss resources/css/index.css -o resources/dist/headings.css"
    },
    "devDependencies": {
        "cssnano": "^6.0.1",
        "postcss": "^8.4.27",
        "postcss-cli": "^10.1.0",
        "postcss-nesting": "^13.0.0"
    }
}
```

Then we need to install our dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

We will also need to update our `postcss.config.js` file to configure postcss.

```js
module.exports = {
    plugins: [
        require('postcss-nesting')(),
        require('cssnano')({
            preset: 'default',
        }),
    ],
};
```

You may also remove the testing directories and files, but we'll leave them in for now, although we won't be using them for this example, and we highly recommend that you write tests for your plugins.

## Step 3: Setting up the provider

Now that we have our plugin cleaned up, we can start adding our code. The boilerplate in the `src/HeadingsServiceProvider.php` file has a lot going on so, let's delete everything and start from scratch.

We need to be able to register our stylesheet with the Filament Asset Manager so that we can load it on demand in our blade view. To do this, we'll need to add the following to the `packageBooted` method in our service provider.

***Note the `loadedOnRequest()` method. This is important, because it tells Filament to only load the stylesheet when it's needed.***

```php
namespace Awcodes\Headings;

use Filament\Support\Assets\Css;
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentAsset;
use Spatie\LaravelPackageTools\Package;
use Spatie\LaravelPackageTools\PackageServiceProvider;

class HeadingsServiceProvider extends PackageServiceProvider
{
    public static string $name = 'headings';

    public function configurePackage(Package $package): void
    {
        $package->name(static::$name)
            ->hasViews();
    }

    public function packageBooted(): void
    {
        FilamentAsset::register([
            Css::make('headings', __DIR__ . '/../resources/dist/headings.css')->loadedOnRequest(),
        ], 'awcodes/headings');
    }
}
```

## Step 4: Creating our component

Next, we'll need to create our component. Create a new file at `src/Heading.php` and add the following code.

```php
namespace Awcodes\Headings;

use Closure;
use Filament\Forms\Components\Component;
use Filament\Support\Colors\Color;
use Filament\Support\Concerns\HasColor;

class Heading extends Component
{
    use HasColor;

    protected string | int $level = 2;

    protected string | Closure $content = '';

    protected string $view = 'headings::heading';

    final public function __construct(string | int $level)
    {
        $this->level($level);
    }

    public static function make(string | int $level): static
    {
        return app(static::class, ['level' => $level]);
    }

    protected function setUp(): void
    {
        parent::setUp();

        $this->dehydrated(false);
    }

    public function content(string | Closure $content): static
    {
        $this->content = $content;

        return $this;
    }

    public function level(string | int $level): static
    {
        $this->level = $level;

        return $this;
    }

    public function getColor(): array
    {
        return $this->evaluate($this->color) ?? Color::Amber;
    }

    public function getContent(): string
    {
        return $this->evaluate($this->content);
    }

    public function getLevel(): string
    {
        return is_int($this->level) ? 'h' . $this->level : $this->level;
    }
}
```

## Step 5: Rendering our component

Next, we'll need to create the view for our component. Create a new file at `resources/views/heading.blade.php` and add the following code.

We are using x-load to asynchronously load stylesheet, so it's only loaded when necessary. You can learn more about this in the [Core Concepts](/docs/3.x/support/assets#lazy-loading-css) section of the docs.

```blade
@php
    $level = $getLevel();
    $color = $getColor();
@endphp

<{{ $level }}
    x-data
    x-load-css="[@js(\Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentAsset::getStyleHref('headings', package: 'awcodes/headings'))]"
    {{
        $attributes
            ->class([
                'headings-component',
                match ($color) {
                    'gray' => 'text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400',
                    default => 'text-custom-500',
                },
            ])
            ->style([
                \Filament\Support\get_color_css_variables($color, [500]) => $color !== 'gray',
            ])
    }}
>
    {{ $getContent() }}
</{{ $level }}>
```

## Step 6: Adding some styles

Next, let's provide some custom styling for our field. We'll add the following to `resources/css/index.css`. And run `npm run build` to compile our css.

```css
.headings-component {
    &:is(h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6) {
         font-weight: 700;
         letter-spacing: -.025em;
         line-height: 1.1;
     }

    &h1 {
         font-size: 2rem;
     }

    &h2 {
         font-size: 1.75rem;
     }

    &h3 {
         font-size: 1.5rem;
     }

    &h4 {
         font-size: 1.25rem;
     }

    &h5,
    &h6 {
         font-size: 1rem;
     }
}
```

Then we need to build our stylesheet.

```bash
npm run build
```

## Step 7: Update your README

You'll want to update your `README.md` file to include instructions on how to install your plugin and any other information you want to share with users, Like how to use it in their projects. For example:

```php
use Awcodes\Headings\Heading;

Heading::make(2)
    ->content('Product Information')
    ->color(Color::Lime),
```

And, that's it, our users can now install our plugin and use it in their projects.

# Documentation for support. File: 09-blade-components/02-avatar.md
---
title: Avatar Blade component
---

## Overview

The avatar component is used to render a circular or square image, often used to represent a user or entity as their "profile picture":

```blade
<x-filament::avatar
    src="https://filamentphp.com/dan.jpg"
    alt="Dan Harrin"
/>
```

## Setting the rounding of an avatar

Avatars are fully rounded by default, but you may make them square by setting the `circular` attribute to `false`:

```blade
<x-filament::avatar
    src="https://filamentphp.com/dan.jpg"
    alt="Dan Harrin"
    :circular="false"
/>
```

## Setting the size of an avatar

By default, the avatar will be "medium" size. You can set the size to either `sm`, `md`, or `lg` using the `size` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::avatar
    src="https://filamentphp.com/dan.jpg"
    alt="Dan Harrin"
    size="lg"
/>
```

You can also pass your own custom size classes into the `size` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::avatar
    src="https://filamentphp.com/dan.jpg"
    alt="Dan Harrin"
    size="w-12 h-12"
/>

# Documentation for support. File: 09-blade-components/02-badge.md
---
title: Badge Blade component
---

## Overview

The badge component is used to render a small box with some text inside:

```blade
<x-filament::badge>
    New
</x-filament::badge>
```

## Setting the size of a badge

By default, the size of a badge is "medium". You can make it "extra small" or "small" by using the `size` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::badge size="xs">
    New
</x-filament::badge>

<x-filament::badge size="sm">
    New
</x-filament::badge>
```

## Changing the color of the badge

By default, the color of a badge is "primary". You can change it to be `danger`, `gray`, `info`, `success` or `warning` by using the `color` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::badge color="danger">
    New
</x-filament::badge>

<x-filament::badge color="gray">
    New
</x-filament::badge>

<x-filament::badge color="info">
    New
</x-filament::badge>

<x-filament::badge color="success">
    New
</x-filament::badge>

<x-filament::badge color="warning">
    New
</x-filament::badge>
```

## Adding an icon to a badge

You can add an [icon](https://blade-ui-kit.com/blade-icons?set=1#search) to a badge by using the `icon` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::badge icon="heroicon-m-sparkles">
    New
</x-filament::badge>
```

You can also change the icon's position to be after the text instead of before it, using the `icon-position` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::badge
    icon="heroicon-m-sparkles"
    icon-position="after"
>
    New
</x-filament::badge>
```

# Documentation for support. File: 09-blade-components/02-breadcrumbs.md
---
title: Breadcrumbs Blade component
---

## Overview

The breadcrumbs component is used to render a simple, linear navigation that informs the user of their current location within the application:

```blade
<x-filament::breadcrumbs :breadcrumbs="[
    '/' => 'Home',
    '/dashboard' => 'Dashboard',
    '/dashboard/users' => 'Users',
    '/dashboard/users/create' => 'Create User',
]" />
```

The keys of the array are URLs that the user is able to click on to navigate, and the values are the text that will be displayed for each link.

# Documentation for support. File: 09-blade-components/02-button.md
---
title: Button Blade component
---

## Overview

The button component is used to render a clickable button that can perform an action:

```blade
<x-filament::button wire:click="openNewUserModal">
    New user
</x-filament::button>
```

## Using a button as an anchor link

By default, a button's underlying HTML tag is `<button>`. You can change it to be an `<a>` tag by using the `tag` attribute:

    New user
</x-filament::button>
```

## Adding a badge to a button

You can render a [badge](badge) on top of a button by using the `badge` slot:

```blade
<x-filament::button>
    Mark notifications as read
    
    <x-slot name="badge">
        3
    </x-slot>
</x-filament::button>
```

You can [change the color](badge#changing-the-color-of-the-badge) of the badge using the `badge-color` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::button badge-color="danger">
    Mark notifications as read
    
    <x-slot name="badge">
        3
    </x-slot>
</x-filament::button>
```

# Documentation for support. File: 09-blade-components/02-checkbox.md
---
title: Checkbox Blade component
---

## Overview

You can use the checkbox component to render a checkbox input that can be used to toggle a boolean value:

```blade
<label>
    <x-filament::input.checkbox wire:model="isAdmin" />

    <span>
        Is Admin
    </span>
</label>
```

## Triggering the error state of the checkbox

The checkbox has special styling that you can use if it is invalid. To trigger this styling, you can use either Blade or Alpine.js.

To trigger the error state using Blade, you can pass the `valid` attribute to the component, which contains either true or false based on if the checkbox is valid or not:

```blade
<x-filament::input.checkbox
    wire:model="isAdmin"
    :valid="! $errors->has('isAdmin')"
/>
```

Alternatively, you can use an Alpine.js expression to trigger the error state, based on if it evaluates to `true` or `false`:

```blade
<div x-data="{ errors: ['isAdmin'] }">
    <x-filament::input.checkbox
        x-model="isAdmin"
        alpine-valid="! errors.includes('isAdmin')"
    />
</div>
```

# Documentation for support. File: 09-blade-components/02-dropdown.md
---
title: Dropdown Blade component
---

## Overview

The dropdown component allows you to render a dropdown menu with a button that triggers it:

```blade
<x-filament::dropdown>
    <x-slot name="trigger">
        <x-filament::button>
            More actions
        </x-filament::button>
    </x-slot>
    
    <x-filament::dropdown.list>
        <x-filament::dropdown.list.item wire:click="openViewModal">
            View
        </x-filament::dropdown.list.item>
        
        <x-filament::dropdown.list.item wire:click="openEditModal">
            Edit
        </x-filament::dropdown.list.item>
        
        <x-filament::dropdown.list.item wire:click="openDeleteModal">
            Delete
        </x-filament::dropdown.list.item>
    </x-filament::dropdown.list>
</x-filament::dropdown>
```

## Using a dropdown item as an anchor link

By default, a dropdown item's underlying HTML tag is `<button>`. You can change it to be an `<a>` tag by using the `tag` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::dropdown.list.item
    href="https://filamentphp.com"
    tag="a"
>
    Filament
</x-filament::dropdown.list.item>
```

## Changing the color of a dropdown item

By default, the color of a dropdown item is "gray". You can change it to be `danger`, `info`, `primary`, `success` or `warning` by using the `color` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::dropdown.list.item color="danger">
    Edit
</x-filament::dropdown.list.item>

<x-filament::dropdown.list.item color="info">
    Edit
</x-filament::dropdown.list.item>

<x-filament::dropdown.list.item color="primary">
    Edit
</x-filament::dropdown.list.item>

<x-filament::dropdown.list.item color="success">
    Edit
</x-filament::dropdown.list.item>

<x-filament::dropdown.list.item color="warning">
    Edit
</x-filament::dropdown.list.item>
```

## Adding an icon to a dropdown item

You can add an [icon](https://blade-ui-kit.com/blade-icons?set=1#search) to a dropdown item by using the `icon` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::dropdown.list.item icon="heroicon-m-pencil">
    Edit
</x-filament::dropdown.list.item>
```

### Changing the icon color of a dropdown item

By default, the icon color uses the [same color as the item itself](#changing-the-color-of-a-dropdown-item). You can override it to be `danger`, `info`, `primary`, `success` or `warning` by using the `icon-color` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::dropdown.list.item icon="heroicon-m-pencil" icon-color="danger">
    Edit
</x-filament::dropdown.list.item>

<x-filament::dropdown.list.item icon="heroicon-m-pencil" icon-color="info">
    Edit
</x-filament::dropdown.list.item>

<x-filament::dropdown.list.item icon="heroicon-m-pencil" icon-color="primary">
    Edit
</x-filament::dropdown.list.item>

<x-filament::dropdown.list.item icon="heroicon-m-pencil" icon-color="success">
    Edit
</x-filament::dropdown.list.item>

<x-filament::dropdown.list.item icon="heroicon-m-pencil" icon-color="warning">
    Edit
</x-filament::dropdown.list.item>
```

## Adding an image to a dropdown item

You can add a circular image to a dropdown item by using the `image` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::dropdown.list.item image="https://filamentphp.com/dan.jpg">
    Dan Harrin
</x-filament::dropdown.list.item>
```

## Adding a badge to a dropdown item

You can render a [badge](badge) on top of a dropdown item by using the `badge` slot:

```blade
<x-filament::dropdown.list.item>
    Mark notifications as read
    
    <x-slot name="badge">
        3
    </x-slot>
</x-filament::dropdown.list.item>
```

You can [change the color](badge#changing-the-color-of-the-badge) of the badge using the `badge-color` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::dropdown.list.item badge-color="danger">
    Mark notifications as read
    
    <x-slot name="badge">
        3
    </x-slot>
</x-filament::dropdown.list.item>
```

## Setting the placement of a dropdown

The dropdown may be positioned relative to the trigger button by using the `placement` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::dropdown placement="top-start">
    {{-- Dropdown items --}}
</x-filament::dropdown>
```

## Setting the width of a dropdown

The dropdown may be set to a width by using the `width` attribute. Options correspond to [Tailwind's max-width scale](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/max-width). The options are `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, `2xl`, `3xl`, `4xl`, `5xl`, `6xl` and `7xl`:

```blade
<x-filament::dropdown width="xs">
    {{-- Dropdown items --}}
</x-filament::dropdown>
```

## Controlling the maximum height of a dropdown

The dropdown content can have a maximum height using the `max-height` attribute, so that it scrolls. You can pass a [CSS length](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length):

```blade
<x-filament::dropdown max-height="400px">
    {{-- Dropdown items --}}
</x-filament::dropdown>
```

# Documentation for support. File: 09-blade-components/02-fieldset.md

## Overview

The button component is used to render a clickable button that can perform an action:

```blade
<x-filament::icon-button
    icon="heroicon-m-plus"
    wire:click="openNewUserModal"
    label="New label"
/>
```

## Using an icon button as an anchor link

By default, an icon button's underlying HTML tag is `<button>`. You can change it to be an `<a>` tag by using the `tag` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::icon-button
    icon="heroicon-m-arrow-top-right-on-square"
    href="https://filamentphp.com"
    tag="a"
    label="Filament"
/>
```

## Setting the size of an icon button

By default, the size of an icon button is "medium". You can make it "extra small", "small", "large" or "extra large" by using the `size` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::icon-button
    icon="heroicon-m-plus"
    size="xs"
    label="New label"

    icon="heroicon-s-plus"
    size="xl"
    label="New label"
/>
```

## Changing the color of an icon button

By default, the color of an icon button is "primary". You can change it to be `danger`, `gray`, `info`, `success` or `warning` by using the `color` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::icon-button
    icon="heroicon-m-plus"
    color="danger"
    label="New label"
/>

<x-filament::icon-button
    icon="heroicon-m-plus"
    color="gray"
    label="New label"
/>

<x-filament::icon-button
    icon="heroicon-m-plus"
    color="info"
    label="New label"
/>

<x-filament::icon-button
    icon="heroicon-m-plus"
    color="success"
    label="New label"
/>

<x-filament::icon-button
    icon="heroicon-m-plus"
    color="warning"
    label="New label"
/>
```

## Adding a tooltip to an icon button

You can add a tooltip to an icon button by using the `tooltip` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::icon-button
    icon="heroicon-m-plus"
    tooltip="Register a user"
    label="New label"
/>
```

## Adding a badge to an icon button

You can render a [badge](badge) on top of an icon button by using the `badge` slot:

```blade
<x-filament::icon-button
    icon="heroicon-m-x-mark"
    label="Mark notifications as read"
>
    <x-slot name="badge">
        3
    </x-slot>
</x-filament::icon-button>
```

You can [change the color](badge#changing-the-color-of-the-badge) of the badge using the `badge-color` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::icon-button
    icon="heroicon-m-x-mark"
    label="Mark notifications as read"
    badge-color="danger"
>
    <x-slot name="badge">
        3
    </x-slot>
</x-filament::icon-button>
```

# Documentation for support. File: 09-blade-components/02-input-wrapper.md
---
title: Input wrapper Blade component
---

## Overview

The input wrapper component should be used as a wrapper around the [input](input) or [select](select) components. It provides a border and other elements such as a prefix or suffix.

```blade
<x-filament::input.wrapper>
    <x-filament::input
        type="text"
        wire:model="name"
    />
</x-filament::input.wrapper>

<x-filament::input.wrapper>
    <x-filament::input.select wire:model="status">
        <option value="draft">Draft</option>
        <option value="reviewing">Reviewing</option>
        <option value="published">Published</option>
    </x-filament::input.select>
</x-filament::input.wrapper>
```

## Triggering the error state of the input

The component has special styling that you can use if it is invalid. To trigger this styling, you can use either Blade or Alpine.js.

To trigger the error state using Blade, you can pass the `valid` attribute to the component, which contains either true or false based on if the input is valid or not:

```blade
<x-filament::input.wrapper :valid="! $errors->has('name')">
    <x-filament::input
        type="text"
        wire:model="name"
    />
</x-filament::input.wrapper>
```

Alternatively, you can use an Alpine.js expression to trigger the error state, based on if it evaluates to `true` or `false`:

```blade
<div x-data="{ errors: ['name'] }">
    <x-filament::input.wrapper alpine-valid="! errors.includes('name')">
        <x-filament::input
            type="text"
            wire:model="name"
        />
    </x-filament::input.wrapper>
</div>
```

## Disabling the input

To disable the input, you must also pass the `disabled` attribute to the wrapper component:

```blade
<x-filament::input.wrapper disabled>
    <x-filament::input
        type="text"
        wire:model="name"
        disabled
    />
</x-filament::input.wrapper>
```

## Adding affix text aside the input

You may place text before and after the input using the `prefix` and `suffix` slots:

```blade
<x-filament::input.wrapper>
    <x-slot name="prefix">
        https://
    </x-slot>

    <x-filament::input
        type="text"
        wire:model="domain"
    />

    <x-slot name="suffix">
        .com
    </x-slot>
</x-filament::input.wrapper>
```

### Using icons as affixes

You may place an [icon](https://blade-ui-kit.com/blade-icons?set=1#search) before and after the input using the `prefix-icon` and `suffix-icon` attributes:

```blade
<x-filament::input.wrapper suffix-icon="heroicon-m-globe-alt">
    <x-filament::input
        type="url"
        wire:model="domain"
    />
</x-filament::input.wrapper>
```

#### Setting the affix icon's color

Affix icons are gray by default, but you may set a different color using the `prefix-icon-color` and `affix-icon-color` attributes:

```blade
<x-filament::input.wrapper
    suffix-icon="heroicon-m-check-circle"
    suffix-icon-color="success"
>
    <x-filament::input
        type="url"
        wire:model="domain"
    />
</x-filament::input.wrapper>
```

# Documentation for support. File: 09-blade-components/02-input.md
---
title: Input Blade component
---

## Overview

The input component is a wrapper around the native `<input>` element. It provides a simple interface for entering a single line of text.

```blade
<x-filament::input.wrapper>
    <x-filament::input
        type="text"
        wire:model="name"
    />
</x-filament::input.wrapper>
```

To use the input component, you must wrap it in an "input wrapper" component, which provides a border and other elements such as a prefix or suffix. You can learn more about customizing the input wrapper component [here](input-wrapper).

# Documentation for support. File: 09-blade-components/02-link.md
---
title: Link Blade component
---

## Overview

The link component is used to render a clickable link that can perform an action:

```blade
<x-filament::link :href="route('users.create')">
    New user
</x-filament::link>
```

## Using a link as a button

By default, a link's underlying HTML tag is `<a>`. You can change it to be a `<button>` tag by using the `tag` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::link
    wire:click="openNewUserModal"
    tag="button"
>
    New user
</x-filament::link>
```

## Setting the size of a link

By default, the size of a link is "medium". You can make it "small", "large", "extra large" or "extra extra large" by using the `size` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::link size="sm">
    New user
</x-filament::link>

<x-filament::link size="lg">
    New user
</x-filament::link>

<x-filament::link size="xl">
    New user
</x-filament::link>

<x-filament::link size="2xl">
    New user
</x-filament::link>
```

## Setting the font weight of a link

By default, the font weight of links is `semibold`. You can make it `thin`, `extralight`, `light`, `normal`, `medium`, `bold`, `extrabold` or `black` by using the `weight` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::link weight="thin">
    New user
</x-filament::link>

<x-filament::link weight="extralight">
    New user
</x-filament::link>

<x-filament::link weight="light">
    New user
</x-filament::link>

<x-filament::link weight="normal">
    New user
</x-filament::link>

<x-filament::link weight="medium">
    New user
</x-filament::link>

<x-filament::link weight="semibold">
    New user
</x-filament::link>
   
<x-filament::link weight="bold">
    New user
</x-filament::link>

<x-filament::link weight="black">
    New user
</x-filament::link> 
```

Alternatively, you can pass in a custom CSS class to define the weight:

```blade
<x-filament::link weight="md:font-[650]">
    New user
</x-filament::link>
```

## Changing the color of a link

By default, the color of a link is "primary". You can change it to be `danger`, `gray`, `info`, `success` or `warning` by using the `color` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::link color="danger">
    New user
</x-filament::link>

<x-filament::link color="gray">
    New user
</x-filament::link>

<x-filament::link color="info">
    New user
</x-filament::link>

<x-filament::link color="success">
    New user
</x-filament::link>

<x-filament::link color="warning">
    New user
</x-filament::link>
```

## Adding an icon to a link

You can add an [icon](https://blade-ui-kit.com/blade-icons?set=1#search) to a link by using the `icon` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::link icon="heroicon-m-sparkles">
    New user
</x-filament::link>
```

You can also change the icon's position to be after the text instead of before it, using the `icon-position` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::link
    icon="heroicon-m-sparkles"
    icon-position="after"
>
    New user
</x-filament::link>
```

## Adding a tooltip to a link

You can add a tooltip to a link by using the `tooltip` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::link tooltip="Register a user">
    New user
</x-filament::link>
```

## Adding a badge to a link

You can render a [badge](badge) on top of a link by using the `badge` slot:

```blade
<x-filament::link>
    Mark notifications as read

    <x-slot name="badge">
        3
    </x-slot>
</x-filament::link>
```

You can [change the color](badge#changing-the-color-of-the-badge) of the badge using the `badge-color` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::link badge-color="danger">
    Mark notifications as read

    <x-slot name="badge">
        3

# Documentation for support. File: 09-blade-components/02-loading-indicator.md
---
title: Loading indicator Blade component
---

## Overview

The loading indicator is an animated SVG that can be used to indicate that something is in progress:

```blade
<x-filament::loading-indicator class="h-5 w-5" />
```

# Documentation for support. File: 09-blade-components/02-modal.md
---
title: Modal Blade component
---

## Overview

The modal component is able to open a dialog window or slide-over with any content:

```blade
<x-filament::modal>
    <x-slot name="trigger">
        <x-filament::button>
            Open modal
        </x-filament::button>
    </x-slot>

    {{-- Modal content --}}
</x-filament::modal>
```

## Controlling a modal from JavaScript

You can use the `trigger` slot to render a button that opens the modal. However, this is not required. You have complete control over when the modal opens and closes through JavaScript. First, give the modal an ID so that you can reference it:

```blade
<x-filament::modal id="edit-user">
    {{-- Modal content --}}
</x-filament::modal>
```

Now, you can dispatch an `open-modal` or `close-modal` browser event, passing the modal's ID, which will open or close the modal. For example, from a Livewire component:

```php
$this->dispatch('open-modal', id: 'edit-user');
```

Or from Alpine.js:

```php
$dispatch('open-modal', { id: 'edit-user' })
```

## Adding a heading to a modal

You can add a heading to a modal by using the `heading` slot:

```blade
<x-filament::modal>
    <x-slot name="heading">
        Modal heading
    </x-slot>

    {{-- Modal content --}}
</x-filament::modal>
```

## Adding a description to a modal

You can add a description, below the heading, to a modal by using the `description` slot:

```blade
<x-filament::modal>
    <x-slot name="heading">
        Modal heading
    </x-slot>

    <x-slot name="description">
        Modal description
    </x-slot>

    {{-- Modal content --}}
</x-filament::modal>
```

## Adding an icon to a modal

You can add an [icon](https://blade-ui-kit.com/blade-icons?set=1#search) to a modal by using the `icon` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::modal icon="heroicon-o-information-circle">
    <x-slot name="heading">
        Modal heading
    </x-slot>

    {{-- Modal content --}}
</x-filament::modal>
```

By default, the color of an icon is "primary". You can change it to be `danger`, `gray`, `info`, `success` or `warning` by using the `icon-color` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::modal
    icon="heroicon-o-exclamation-triangle"
    icon-color="danger"
>
    <x-slot name="heading">
        Modal heading
    </x-slot>

    {{-- Modal content --}}
</x-filament::modal>
```

## Adding a footer to a modal

You can add a footer to a modal by using the `footer` slot:

```blade
<x-filament::modal>
    {{-- Modal content --}}
    
    <x-slot name="footer">
        {{-- Modal footer content --}}
    </x-slot>
</x-filament::modal>
```

Alternatively, you can add actions into the footer by using the `footerActions` slot:

```blade
<x-filament::modal>
    {{-- Modal content --}}
    
    <x-slot name="footerActions">
        {{-- Modal footer actions --}}
    </x-slot>
</x-filament::modal>
```

## Changing the modal's alignment

By default, modal content will be aligned to the start, or centered if the modal is `xs` or `sm` in [width](#changing-the-modal-width). If you wish to change the alignment of content in a modal, you can use the `alignment` attribute and pass it `start` or `center`:

```blade
<x-filament::modal alignment="center">
    {{-- Modal content --}}
</x-filament::modal>
```

## Using a slide-over instead of a modal

You can open a "slide-over" dialog instead of a modal by using the `slide-over` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::modal slide-over>
    {{-- Slide-over content --}}
</x-filament::modal>
```

## Making the modal header sticky

The header of a modal scrolls out of view with the modal content when it overflows the modal size. However, slide-overs have a sticky modal that's always visible. You may control this behavior using the `sticky-header` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::modal sticky-header>
    <x-slot name="heading">
        Modal heading
    </x-slot>

    {{-- Modal content --}}
</x-filament::modal>
```

## Making the modal footer sticky

The footer of a modal is rendered inline after the content by default. Slide-overs, however, have a sticky footer that always shows when scrolling the content. You may enable this for a modal too using the `sticky-footer` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::modal sticky-footer>
    {{-- Modal content --}}
    
    <x-slot name="footer">
        {{-- Modal footer content --}}
    </x-slot>
</x-filament::modal>
```

## Changing the modal width

You can change the width of the modal by using the `width` attribute. Options correspond to [Tailwind's max-width scale](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/max-width). The options are `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, `2xl`, `3xl`, `4xl`, `5xl`, `6xl`, `7xl`, and `screen`:

```blade
<x-filament::modal width="5xl">
    {{-- Modal content --}}
</x-filament::modal>
```

## Closing the modal by clicking away

By default, when you click away from a modal, it will close itself. If you wish to disable this behavior for a specific action, you can use the `close-by-clicking-away` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::modal :close-by-clicking-away="false">
    {{-- Modal content --}}
</x-filament::modal>
```

## Closing the modal by escaping

By default, when you press escape on a modal, it will close itself. If you wish to disable this behavior for a specific action, you can use the `close-by-escaping` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::modal :close-by-escaping="false">
    {{-- Modal content --}}
</x-filament::modal>
```

## Hiding the modal close button

By default, modals with a header have a close button in the top right corner. You can remove the close button from the modal by using the `close-button` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::modal :close-button="false">
    <x-slot name="heading">
        Modal heading
    </x-slot>

    {{-- Modal content --}}
</x-filament::modal>
```

## Preventing the modal from autofocusing

By default, modals will autofocus on the first focusable element when opened. If you wish to disable this behavior, you can use the `autofocus` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::modal :autofocus="false">
    {{-- Modal content --}}
</x-filament::modal>
```

## Disabling the modal trigger button

By default, the trigger button will open the modal even if it is disabled, since the click event listener is registered on a wrapping element of the button itself. If you want to prevent the modal from opening, you should also use the `disabled` attribute on the trigger slot:

```blade
<x-filament::modal>
    <x-slot name="trigger" disabled>
        <x-filament::button :disabled="true">
            Open modal
        </x-filament::button>
    </x-slot>
    {{-- Modal content --}}
</x-filament::modal>
```


# Documentation for support. File: 09-blade-components/02-pagination.md
---
title: Pagination Blade component
---

## Overview

The pagination component can be used in a Livewire Blade view only. It can render a list of paginated links:

```php
use App\Models\User;
use Illuminate\Contracts\View\View;
use Livewire\Component;

class ListUsers extends Component
{
    // ...
    
    public function render(): View
    {
        return view('livewire.list-users', [
            'users' => User::query()->paginate(10),
        ]);
    }
}
```

```blade
<x-filament::pagination :paginator="$users" />
```

Alternatively, you can use simple pagination or cursor pagination, which will just render a "previous" and "next" button:

```php
use App\Models\User;

User::query()->simplePaginate(10)
User::query()->cursorPaginate(10)
```

## Allowing the user to customize the number of items per page

You can allow the user to customize the number of items per page by passing an array of options to the `page-options` attribute. You must also define a Livewire property where the user's selection will be stored:

```php
use App\Models\User;
use Illuminate\Contracts\View\View;
use Livewire\Component;

class ListUsers extends Component
{
    public int | string $perPage = 10;
    
    // ...
    
    public function render(): View
    {
        return view('livewire.list-users', [
            'users' => User::query()->paginate($this->perPage),
        ]);
    }
}
```

```blade
<x-filament::pagination
    :paginator="$users"
    :page-options="[5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 'all']"
    :current-page-option-property="perPage"
/>
```

## Displaying links to the first and the last page

Extreme links are the first and last page links. You can add them by passing the `extreme-links` attribute to the component:

```blade
<x-filament::pagination
    :paginator="$users"
    extreme-links
/>
```

# Documentation for support. File: 09-blade-components/02-section.md
---
title: Section Blade component
---

## Overview

A section can be used to group content together, with an optional heading:

```blade
<x-filament::section>
    <x-slot name="heading">
        User details
    </x-slot>

    {{-- Content --}}
</x-filament::section>
```

## Adding a description to the section

You can add a description below the heading to the section by using the `description` slot:

```blade
<x-filament::section>
    <x-slot name="heading">
        User details
    </x-slot>

    <x-slot name="description">
        This is all the information we hold about the user.
    </x-slot>

    {{-- Content --}}
</x-filament::section>
```

## Adding an icon to the section header

You can add an [icon](https://blade-ui-kit.com/blade-icons?set=1#search) to a section by using the `icon` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::section icon="heroicon-o-user">
    <x-slot name="heading">
        User details
    </x-slot>

    {{-- Content --}}
</x-filament::section>
```

### Changing the color of the section icon

By default, the color of the section icon is "gray". You can change it to be `danger`, `info`, `primary`, `success` or `warning` by using the `icon-color` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::section
    icon="heroicon-o-user"
    icon-color="info"
>
    <x-slot name="heading">
        User details
    </x-slot>

    {{-- Content --}}
</x-filament::section>
```

### Changing the size of the section icon

By default, the size of the section icon is "large". You can change it to be "small" or "medium" by using the `icon-size` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::section
    icon="heroicon-m-user"
    icon-size="sm"
>
    <x-slot name="heading">
        User details
    </x-slot>

    {{-- Content --}}
</x-filament::section>

<x-filament::section
    icon="heroicon-m-user"
    icon-size="md"
>
    <x-slot name="heading">
        User details
    </x-slot>

    {{-- Content --}}
</x-filament::section>
```

## Adding content to the end of the header

You may render additional content at the end of the header, next to the heading and description, using the `headerEnd` slot:

```blade
<x-filament::section>
    <x-slot name="heading">
        User details
    </x-slot>

    <x-slot name="headerEnd">
        {{-- Input to select the user's ID --}}
    </x-slot>

    {{-- Content --}}
</x-filament::section>
```

## Making a section collapsible

You can make the content of a section collapsible by using the `collapsible` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::section collapsible>
    <x-slot name="heading">
        User details
    </x-slot>

    {{-- Content --}}
</x-filament::section>
```

### Making a section collapsed by default

You can make a section collapsed by default by using the `collapsed` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::section
    collapsible
    collapsed
>
    <x-slot name="heading">
        User details
    </x-slot>

    {{-- Content --}}
</x-filament::section>
```

### Persisting collapsed sections

You can persist whether a section is collapsed in local storage using the `persist-collapsed` attribute, so it will remain collapsed when the user refreshes the page. You will also need a unique `id` attribute to identify the section from others, so that each section can persist its own collapse state:

```blade
<x-filament::section
    collapsible
    collapsed
    persist-collapsed
    id="user-details"
>
    <x-slot name="heading">
        User details
    </x-slot>

    {{-- Content --}}
</x-filament::section>
```

## Adding the section header aside the content instead of above it

You can change the position of the section header to be aside the content instead of above it by using the `aside` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::section aside>
    <x-slot name="heading">
        User details
    </x-slot>

    {{-- Content --}}
</x-filament::section>
```

### Positioning the content before the header

You can change the position of the content to be before the header instead of after it by using the `content-before` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::section
    aside
    content-before
>
    <x-slot name="heading">
        User details
    </x-slot>

    {{-- Content --}}
</x-filament::section>
```

# Documentation for support. File: 09-blade-components/02-select.md
---
title: Select Blade component
---

## Overview

The select component is a wrapper around the native `<select>` element. It provides a simple interface for selecting a single value from a list of options:

```blade
<x-filament::input.wrapper>
    <x-filament::input.select wire:model="status">
        <option value="draft">Draft</option>
        <option value="reviewing">Reviewing</option>
        <option value="published">Published</option>
    </x-filament::input.select>
</x-filament::input.wrapper>
```

To use the select component, you must wrap it in an "input wrapper" component, which provides a border and other elements such as a prefix or suffix. You can learn more about customizing the input wrapper component [here](input-wrapper).

# Documentation for support. File: 09-blade-components/02-tabs.md
---
title: Tabs Blade component
---

## Overview

The tabs component allows you to render a set of tabs, which can be used to toggle between multiple sections of content:

```blade
<x-filament::tabs label="Content tabs">
    <x-filament::tabs.item>
        Tab 1
    </x-filament::tabs.item>

    <x-filament::tabs.item>
        Tab 2
    </x-filament::tabs.item>

    <x-filament::tabs.item>
        Tab 3
    </x-filament::tabs.item>
</x-filament::tabs>
```

## Triggering the active state of the tab

By default, tabs do not appear "active". To make a tab appear active, you can use the `active` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::tabs>
    <x-filament::tabs.item active>
        Tab 1
    </x-filament::tabs.item>

    {{-- Other tabs --}}
</x-filament::tabs>
```

You can also use the `active` attribute to make a tab appear active conditionally:

```blade
<x-filament::tabs>
    <x-filament::tabs.item
        :active="$activeTab === 'tab1'"
        wire:click="$set('activeTab', 'tab1')"
    >
        Tab 1
    </x-filament::tabs.item>

    {{-- Other tabs --}}
</x-filament::tabs>
```

Or you can use the `alpine-active` attribute to make a tab appear active conditionally using Alpine.js:

```blade
<x-filament::tabs x-data="{ activeTab: 'tab1' }">
    <x-filament::tabs.item
        alpine-active="activeTab === 'tab1'"
        x-on:click="activeTab = 'tab1'"
    >
        Tab 1
    </x-filament::tabs.item>

    {{-- Other tabs --}}
</x-filament::tabs>
```

## Setting a tab icon

Tabs may have an [icon](https://blade-ui-kit.com/blade-icons?set=1#search), which you can set using the `icon` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::tabs>
    <x-filament::tabs.item icon="heroicon-m-bell">
        Notifications
    </x-filament::tabs.item>

    {{-- Other tabs --}}
</x-filament::tabs>
```

### Setting the tab icon position

The icon of the tab may be positioned before or after the label using the `icon-position` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::tabs>
    <x-filament::tabs.item
        icon="heroicon-m-bell"
        icon-position="after"
    >
        Notifications
    </x-filament::tabs.item>

    {{-- Other tabs --}}
</x-filament::tabs>
```

## Setting a tab badge

Tabs may have a [badge](badge), which you can set using the `badge` slot:

```blade
<x-filament::tabs>
    <x-filament::tabs.item>
        Notifications

        <x-slot name="badge">
            5
        </x-slot>
    </x-filament::tabs.item>

    {{-- Other tabs --}}
</x-filament::tabs>
```

## Using a tab as an anchor link

By default, a tab's underlying HTML tag is `<button>`. You can change it to be an `<a>` tag by using the `tag` attribute:

```blade
<x-filament::tabs>
    <x-filament::tabs.item
        :href="route('notifications')"
        tag="a"
    >
        Notifications
    </x-filament::tabs.item>

    {{-- Other tabs --}}
</x-filament::tabs>
```

# Documentation for tables. File: 01-installation.md
---
title: Installation
---

**The Table Builder package is pre-installed with the [Panel Builder](/docs/panels).** This guide is for using the Table Builder in a custom TALL Stack application (Tailwind, Alpine, Livewire, Laravel).

## Requirements

Filament requires the following to run:

- PHP 8.1+
- Laravel v10.0+
- Livewire v3.0+
- Tailwind v3.0+ [(Using Tailwind v4?)](#installing-tailwind-css)

## Installation

Require the Table Builder package using Composer:

```bash
composer require filament/tables:"^3.3" -W
```

## New Laravel projects

To quickly get started with Filament in a new Laravel project, run the following commands to install [Livewire](https://livewire.laravel.com), [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com):

> Since these commands will overwrite existing files in your application, only run this in a new Laravel project!

```bash
php artisan filament:install --scaffold --tables

npm install

npm run dev
```

## Existing Laravel projects

Run the following command to install the Table Builder assets:

```bash
php artisan filament:install --tables
```

### Installing Tailwind CSS

> Filament uses Tailwind CSS v3 for styling. If your project uses Tailwind CSS v4, you will unfortunately need to downgrade it to v3 to use Filament. Filament v3 can't support Tailwind CSS v4 since it introduces breaking changes. Filament v4 will support Tailwind CSS v4.

Run the following command to install Tailwind CSS with the Tailwind Forms and Typography plugins:

```bash
npm install tailwindcss@3 @tailwindcss/forms @tailwindcss/typography postcss postcss-nesting autoprefixer --save-dev
```

Create a new `tailwind.config.js` file and add the Filament `preset` *(includes the Filament color scheme and the required Tailwind plugins)*:

```js
import preset from './vendor/filament/support/tailwind.config.preset'

export default {
    presets: [preset],
    content: [
        './app/Filament/**/*.php',
        './resources/views/filament/**/*.blade.php',
        './vendor/filament/**/*.blade.php',
    ],
}
```

### Configuring styles

Add Tailwind's CSS layers to your `resources/css/app.css`:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
@tailwind variants;
```

Create a `postcss.config.js` file in the root of your project and register Tailwind CSS, PostCSS Nesting and Autoprefixer as plugins:

```js
export default {
    plugins: {
        'tailwindcss/nesting': 'postcss-nesting',
        tailwindcss: {},
        autoprefixer: {},
    },
}
```

### Automatically refreshing the browser
You may also want to update your `vite.config.js` file to refresh the page automatically when Livewire components are updated:

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import laravel, { refreshPaths } from 'laravel-vite-plugin'

export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [
        laravel({
            input: ['resources/css/app.css', 'resources/js/app.js'],
            refresh: [
                ...refreshPaths,
                'app/Livewire/**',
            ],
        }),
    ],
})
```

### Compiling assets

Compile your new CSS and Javascript assets using `npm run dev`.

### Configuring your layout

Create a new `resources/views/components/layouts/app.blade.php` layout file for Livewire components:

```blade
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="{{ str_replace('_', '-', app()->getLocale()) }}">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">

        <meta name="application-name" content="{{ config('app.name') }}">
        <meta name="csrf-token" content="{{ csrf_token() }}">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

        <title>{{ config('app.name') }}</title>

        <style>
            [x-cloak] {
                display: none !important;
            }
        </style>

        @filamentStyles
        @vite('resources/css/app.css')
    </head>

    <body class="antialiased">
        {{ $slot }}

        @filamentScripts
        @vite('resources/js/app.js')
    </body>
</html>
```

## Publishing configuration

You can publish the package configuration using the following command (optional):

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=filament-config
```

## Upgrading

> Upgrading from Filament v2? Please review the [upgrade guide](upgrade-guide).

Filament automatically upgrades to the latest non-breaking version when you run `composer update`. After any updates, all Laravel caches need to be cleared, and frontend assets need to be republished. You can do this all at once using the `filament:upgrade` command, which should have been added to your `composer.json` file when you ran `filament:install` the first time:

```json
"post-autoload-dump": [
    // ...
    "@php artisan filament:upgrade"
],
```

Please note that `filament:upgrade` does not actually handle the update process, as Composer does that already. If you're upgrading manually without a `post-autoload-dump` hook, you can run the command yourself:

```bash
composer update

php artisan filament:upgrade
```

# Documentation for tables. File: 02-getting-started.md

title: Getting started
---
import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"

## Overview

Filament's Table Builder package allows you to [add an interactive datatable to any Livewire component](adding-a-table-to-a-livewire-component). It's also used within other Filament packages, such as the [Panel Builder](../panels) for displaying [resources](../panels/resources/getting-started) and [relation managers](../panels/resources/relation-managers), as well as for the [table widget](../panels/dashboard#table-widgets). Learning the features of the Table Builder will be incredibly time-saving when both building your own custom Livewire tables and using Filament's other packages.

This guide will walk you through the basics of building tables with Filament's table package. If you're planning to add a new table to your own Livewire component, you should [do that first](adding-a-table-to-a-livewire-component) and then come back. If you're adding a table to an [app resource](../panels/resources/getting-started), or another Filament package, you're ready to go!

## Defining table columns

The basis of any table is rows and columns. Filament uses Eloquent to get the data for rows in the table, and you are responsible for defining the columns that are used in that row.

Filament includes many column types prebuilt for you, and you can [view a full list here](columns/getting-started#available-columns). You can even [create your own custom column types](columns/custom) to display data in whatever way you need.

Columns are stored in an array, as objects within the `$table->columns()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\IconColumn;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            TextColumn::make('title'),
            TextColumn::make('slug'),
            IconColumn::make('is_featured')
                ->boolean(),
        ]);
}
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/getting-started/columns" alt="Table with columns" version="3.x" />

In this example, there are 3 columns in the table. The first two display [text](columns/text) - the title and slug of each row in the table. The third column displays an [icon](columns/icon), either a green check or a red cross depending on if the row is featured or not.

### Making columns sortable and searchable

You can easily modify columns by chaining methods onto them. For example, you can make a column [searchable](columns/getting-started#searching) using the `searchable()` method. Now, there will be a search field in the table, and you will be able to filter rows by the value of that column:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('title')
    ->searchable()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/getting-started/searchable-columns" alt="Table with searchable column" version="3.x" />

You can make multiple columns searchable, and Filament will be able to search for matches within any of them, all at once.

You can also make a column [sortable](columns/getting-started#sorting) using the `sortable()` method. This will add a sort button to the column header, and clicking it will sort the table by that column:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('title')
    ->sortable()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/getting-started/sortable-columns" alt="Table with sortable column" version="3.x" />

### Accessing related data from columns

You can also display data in a column that belongs to a relationship. For example, if you have a `Post` model that belongs to a `User` model (the author of the post), you can display the user's name in the table:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('author.name')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/getting-started/relationship-columns" alt="Table with relationship column" version="3.x" />

In this case, Filament will search for an `author` relationship on the `Post` model, and then display the `name` attribute of that relationship. We call this "dot notation" - you can use it to display any attribute of any relationship, even nested distant relationships. Filament uses this dot notation to eager-load the results of that relationship for you.

## Defining table filters

As well as making columns `searchable()`, you can allow the users to filter rows in the table in other ways. We call these components "filters", and they are defined in the `$table->filters()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\Filter;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\SelectFilter;
use Filament\Tables\Table;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            // ...
        ])
        ->filters([
            Filter::make('is_featured')
                ->query(fn (Builder $query) => $query->where('is_featured', true)),
            SelectFilter::make('status')
                ->options([
                    'draft' => 'Draft',
                    'reviewing' => 'Reviewing',
                    'published' => 'Published',
                ]),
        ]);
}
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/getting-started/filters" alt="Table with filters" version="3.x" />

In this example, we have defined 2 table filters. On the table, there is now a "filter" icon button in the top corner. Clicking it will open a dropdown with the 2 filters we have defined.

The first filter is rendered as a checkbox. When it's checked, only featured rows in the table will be displayed. When it's unchecked, all rows will be displayed.

The second filter is rendered as a select dropdown. When a user selects an option, only rows with that status will be displayed. When no option is selected, all rows will be displayed.

It's possible to define as many filters as you need, and use any component from the [Form Builder package](../forms) to create a UI. For example, you could create [a custom date range filter](../filters/custom).

## Defining table actions

Filament's tables can use [Actions](../actions/overview). They are buttons that can be added to the [end of any table row](actions#row-actions), or even in the [header](actions#header-actions) of a table. For instance, you may want an action to "create" a new record in the header, and then "edit" and "delete" actions on each row. [Bulk actions](actions#bulk-actions) can be used to execute code when records in the table are selected.

```php
use App\Models\Post;
use Filament\Tables\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Tables\Actions\BulkActionGroup;
use Filament\Tables\Actions\DeleteBulkAction;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            // ...
        ])
        ->actions([
            Action::make('feature')
                ->action(function (Post $record) {
                    $record->is_featured = true;
                    $record->save();
                })
                ->hidden(fn (Post $record): bool => $record->is_featured),
            Action::make('unfeature')
                ->action(function (Post $record) {
                    $record->is_featured = false;
                    $record->save();
                })
                ->visible(fn (Post $record): bool => $record->is_featured),
        ])
        ->bulkActions([
            BulkActionGroup::make([
                DeleteBulkAction::make(),
            ]),
        ]);
}
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/getting-started/actions" alt="Table with actions" version="3.x" />

In this example, we define 2 actions for table rows. The first action is a "feature" action. When clicked, it will set the `is_featured` attribute on the record to `true` - which is written within the `action()` method. Using the `hidden()` method, the action will be hidden if the record is already featured. The second action is an "unfeature" action. When clicked, it will set the `is_featured` attribute on the record to `false`. Using the `visible()` method, the action will be hidden if the record is not featured.

We also define a bulk action. When bulk actions are defined, each row in the table will have a checkbox. This bulk action is [built-in to Filament](../actions/prebuilt-actions/delete#bulk-delete), and it will delete all selected records. However, you can [write your own custom bulk actions](actions#bulk-actions) easily too.

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/getting-started/actions-modal" alt="Table with action modal open" version="3.x" />

Actions can also open modals to request confirmation from the user, as well as render forms inside to collect extra data. It's a good idea to read the [Actions documentation](../actions/overview) to learn more about their extensive capabilities throughout Filament.

## Overview

<LaracastsBanner
    title="Table Columns"
    description="Watch the Rapid Laravel Development with Filament series on Laracasts - it will teach you the basics of adding columns to Filament resource tables."
    url="https://laracasts.com/series/rapid-laravel-development-with-filament/episodes/9"
    series="rapid-laravel-development"
/>

Column classes can be found in the `Filament\Tables\Columns` namespace. You can put them inside the `$table->columns()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

Columns may be created using the static `make()` method, passing its unique name. The name of the column should correspond to a column or accessor on your model. You may use "dot notation" to access columns within relationships.

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('title')

TextColumn::make('author.name')
```

## Available columns

Filament ships with two main types of columns - static and editable.

Static columns display data to the user:

- [Text column](text)
- [Icon column](icon)
- [Image column](image)
- [Color column](color)

Editable columns allow the user to update data in the database without leaving the table:

- [Select column](select)
- [Toggle column](toggle)
- [Text input column](text-input)
- [Checkbox column](checkbox)

You may also [create your own custom columns](custom) to display data however you wish.

## Setting a label

By default, the label of the column, which is displayed in the header of the table, is generated from the name of the column. You may customize this using the `label()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('title')
    ->label('Post title')
```

Optionally, you can have the label automatically translated [using Laravel's localization features](https://laravel.com/docs/localization) with the `translateLabel()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('title')
    ->translateLabel() // Equivalent to `label(__('Title'))`
```

## Sorting

Columns may be sortable, by clicking on the column label. To make a column sortable, you must use the `sortable()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('name')
    ->sortable()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/sortable" alt="Table with sortable column" version="3.x" />

If you're using an accessor column, you may pass `sortable()` an array of database columns to sort by:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('full_name')
    ->sortable(['first_name', 'last_name'])
```

You may customize how the sorting is applied to the Eloquent query using a callback:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

TextColumn::make('full_name')
    ->sortable(query: function (Builder $query, string $direction): Builder {
        return $query
            ->orderBy('last_name', $direction)
            ->orderBy('first_name', $direction);
    })
```

## Sorting by default

You may choose to sort a table by default if no other sort is applied. You can use the `defaultSort()` method for this:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            // ...
        ])
        ->defaultSort('stock', 'desc');
}
```

### Persist sort in session

To persist the sorting in the user's session, use the `persistSortInSession()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            // ...
        ])
        ->persistSortInSession();
}
```

### Setting a default sort option label

To set a default sort option label, use the `defaultSortOptionLabel()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            // ...
        ])
        ->defaultSortOptionLabel('Date');
}
```

## Searching

Columns may be searchable by using the text input field in the top right of the table. To make a column searchable, you must use the `searchable()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('name')
    ->searchable()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/searchable" alt="Table with searchable column" version="3.x" />

If you're using an accessor column, you may pass `searchable()` an array of database columns to search within:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('full_name')
    ->searchable(['first_name', 'last_name'])
```

You may customize how the search is applied to the Eloquent query using a callback:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

TextColumn::make('full_name')
    ->searchable(query: function (Builder $query, string $search): Builder {
        return $query
            ->where('first_name', 'like', "%{$search}%")
            ->orWhere('last_name', 'like', "%{$search}%");
    })
```

#### Customizing the table search field placeholder

You may customize the placeholder in the search field using the `searchPlaceholder()` method on the `$table`:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public static function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            // ...
        ])
        ->searchPlaceholder('Search (ID, Name)');
}
```

### Searching individually

You can choose to enable a per-column search input field using the `isIndividual` parameter:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('name')
    ->searchable(isIndividual: true)
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/individually-searchable" alt="Table with individually searchable column" version="3.x" />

If you use the `isIndividual` parameter, you may still search that column using the main "global" search input field for the entire table.

To disable that functionality while still preserving the individual search functionality, you need the `isGlobal` parameter:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('title')
    ->searchable(isIndividual: true, isGlobal: false)
```

You may optionally persist the searches in the query string:

```php
use Livewire\Attributes\Url;

/**
 * @var array<string, string | array<string, string | null> | null>
 */
#[Url]
public array $tableColumnSearches = [];
```

### Customizing the table search debounce

You may customize the debounce time in all table search fields using the `searchDebounce()` method on the `$table`. By default it is set to `500ms`:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public static function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            // ...
        ])
        ->searchDebounce('750ms');
}
```

### Searching when the input is blurred

Instead of automatically reloading the table contents while the user is typing their search, which is affected by the [debounce](#customizing-the-table-search-debounce) of the search field, you may change the behavior so that the table is only searched when the user blurs the input (tabs or clicks out of it), using the `searchOnBlur()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public static function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            // ...
        ])
        ->searchOnBlur();
}
```

### Persist search in session

To persist the table or individual column search in the user's session, use the `persistSearchInSession()` or `persistColumnSearchInSession()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            // ...
        ])
        ->persistSearchInSession()
        ->persistColumnSearchesInSession();
}
```

## Column actions and URLs

When a cell is clicked, you may run an "action", or open a URL.

### Running actions

To run an action, you may use the `action()` method, passing a callback or the name of a Livewire method to run. Each method accepts a `$record` parameter which you may use to customize the behavior of the action:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('title')
    ->action(function (Post $record): void {
        $this->dispatch('open-post-edit-modal', post: $record->getKey());
    })
```

#### Action modals

You may open [action modals](../actions#modals) by passing in an `Action` object to the `action()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('title')
    ->action(
        Action::make('select')
            ->requiresConfirmation()
            ->action(function (Post $record): void {
                $this->dispatch('select-post', post: $record->getKey());
            }),
    )
```

Action objects passed into the `action()` method must have a unique name to distinguish it from other actions within the table.

### Opening URLs

To open a URL, you may use the `url()` method, passing a callback or static URL to open. Callbacks accept a `$record` parameter which you may use to customize the URL:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('title')
    ->url(fn (Post $record): string => route('posts.edit', ['post' => $record]))
```

You may also choose to open the URL in a new tab:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('title')
    ->url(fn (Post $record): string => route('posts.edit', ['post' => $record]))
    ->openUrlInNewTab()
```

## Setting a default value

To set a default value for columns with an empty state, you may use the `default()` method. This method will treat the default state as if it were real, so columns like [image](image) or [color](color) will display the default image or color.

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('description')
    ->default('No description.')
```

## Adding placeholder text if a column is empty

Sometimes you may want to display placeholder text for columns with an empty state, which is styled as a lighter gray text. This differs from the [default value](#setting-a-default-value), as the placeholder is always text and not treated as if it were real state.

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('description')
    ->placeholder('No description.')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/placeholder" alt="Column with a placeholder for empty state" version="3.x" />

## Hiding columns

To hide a column conditionally, you may use the `hidden()` and `visible()` methods, whichever you prefer:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('role')
    ->hidden(! auth()->user()->isAdmin())
// or
TextColumn::make('role')
    ->visible(auth()->user()->isAdmin())
```

### Toggling column visibility

Users may hide or show columns themselves in the table. To make a column toggleable, use the `toggleable()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('email')
    ->toggleable()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/toggleable" alt="Table with toggleable column" version="3.x" />

#### Making toggleable columns hidden by default

By default, toggleable columns are visible. To make them hidden instead:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('id')
    ->toggleable(isToggledHiddenByDefault: true)
```

#### Customizing the toggle columns dropdown trigger action

To customize the toggle dropdown trigger button, you may use the `toggleColumnsTriggerAction()` method, passing a closure that returns an action. All methods that are available to [customize action trigger buttons](../actions/trigger-button) can be used:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->filters([
            // ...
        ])
        ->toggleColumnsTriggerAction(
            fn (Action $action) => $action
                ->button()
                ->label('Toggle columns'),
        );
}
```

## Calculated state

Sometimes you need to calculate the state of a column, instead of directly reading it from a database column.

By passing a callback function to the `state()` method, you can customize the returned state for that column based on the `$record`:

```php
use App\Models\Order;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('amount_including_vat')
    ->state(function (Order $record): float {
        return $record->amount * (1 + $record->vat_rate);
    })
```

## Tooltips

You may specify a tooltip to display when you hover over a cell:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('title')
    ->tooltip('Title')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/tooltips" alt="Table with column triggering a tooltip" version="3.x" />

This method also accepts a closure that can access the current table record:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

TextColumn::make('title')
    ->tooltip(fn (Model $record): string => "By {$record->author->name}")
```

## Horizontally aligning column content

Table columns are aligned to the start (left in LTR interfaces or right in RTL interfaces) by default. You may change the alignment using the `alignment()` method, and passing it `Alignment::Start`, `Alignment::Center`, `Alignment::End` or `Alignment::Justify` options:

```php
use Filament\Support\Enums\Alignment;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('email')
    ->alignment(Alignment::End)
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/alignment" alt="Table with column aligned to the end" version="3.x" />

Alternatively, you may use shorthand methods like `alignEnd()`:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('name')
    ->alignEnd()
```

## Vertically aligning column content

Table column content is vertically centered by default. You may change the vertical alignment using the `verticalAlignment()` method, and passing it `VerticalAlignment::Start`, `VerticalAlignment::Center` or `VerticalAlignment::End` options:

```php
use Filament\Support\Enums\VerticalAlignment;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('name')
    ->verticalAlignment(VerticalAlignment::Start)
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/vertical-alignment" alt="Table with column vertically aligned to the start" version="3.x" />

Alternatively, you may use shorthand methods like `verticallyAlignStart()`:

```php
use Filament\Support\Enums\VerticalAlignment;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('name')
    ->verticallyAlignStart()
```

## Allowing column headers to wrap

By default, column headers will not wrap onto multiple lines, if they need more space. You may allow them to wrap using the `wrapHeader()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('name')
    ->wrapHeader()
```

## Controlling the width of columns

By default, columns will take up as much space as they need. You may allow some columns to consume more space than others by using the `grow()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('name')
    ->grow()
```

Alternatively, you can define a width for the column, which is passed to the header cell using the `style` attribute, so you can use any valid CSS value:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\IconColumn;

IconColumn::make('is_paid')
    ->label('Paid')
    ->boolean()
    ->width('1%')
```

## Grouping columns

You group multiple columns together underneath a single heading using a `ColumnGroup` object:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ColumnGroup;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\IconColumn;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            TextColumn::make('title'),
            TextColumn::make('slug'),
            ColumnGroup::make('Visibility', [
                TextColumn::make('status'),
                IconColumn::make('is_featured'),
            ]),
            TextColumn::make('author.name'),
        ]);
}
```

The first argument is the label of the group, and the second is an array of column objects that belong to that group.

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/grouping" alt="Table with grouped columns" version="3.x" />

You can also control the group header [alignment](#horizontally-aligning-column-content) and [wrapping](#allowing-column-headers-to-wrap) on the `ColumnGroup` object. To improve the multi-line fluency of the API, you can chain the `columns()` onto the object instead of passing it as the second argument:

```php
use Filament\Support\Enums\Alignment;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ColumnGroup;

ColumnGroup::make('Website visibility')
    ->columns([
        // ...
    ])
    ->alignment(Alignment::Center)
    ->wrapHeader()
```

## Custom attributes

The HTML of columns can be customized, by passing an array of `extraAttributes()`:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('slug')
    ->extraAttributes(['class' => 'bg-gray-200'])
```

These get merged onto the outer `<div>` element of each cell in that column.

## Global settings

If you wish to change the default behavior of all columns globally, then you can call the static `configureUsing()` method inside a service provider's `boot()` method, to which you pass a Closure to modify the columns using. For example, if you wish to make all columns [`searchable()`](#searching) and [`toggleable()`](#toggling-column-visibility), you can do it like so:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Column;

Column::configureUsing(function (Column $column): void {
    $column
        ->toggleable()
        ->searchable();
});
```

Additionally, you can call this code on specific column types as well:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::configureUsing(function (TextColumn $column): void {
    $column
        ->toggleable()
        ->searchable();
});
```

Of course, you are still able to overwrite this on each column individually:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('name')
    ->toggleable(false)
```

# Documentation for tables. File: 03-columns/02-text.md

import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"

## Overview

Text columns display simple text from your database:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('title')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/text/simple" alt="Text column" version="3.x" />

## Displaying as a "badge"

By default, the text is quite plain and has no background color. You can make it appear as a "badge" instead using the `badge()` method. A great use case for this is with statuses, where may want to display a badge with a [color](#customizing-the-color) that matches the status:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('status')
    ->badge()
    ->color(fn (string $state): string => match ($state) {
        'draft' => 'gray',
        'reviewing' => 'warning',
        'published' => 'success',
        'rejected' => 'danger',
    })
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/text/badge" alt="Text column as badge" version="3.x" />

You may add other things to the badge, like an [icon](#adding-an-icon).

## Displaying a description

Descriptions may be used to easily render additional text above or below the column contents.

You can display a description below the contents of a text column using the `description()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('title')
    ->description(fn (Post $record): string => $record->description)
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/text/description" alt="Text column with description" version="3.x" />

By default, the description is displayed below the main text, but you can move it above using the second parameter:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('title')
    ->description(fn (Post $record): string => $record->description, position: 'above')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/text/description-above" alt="Text column with description above the content" version="3.x" />

## Date formatting

You may use the `date()` and `dateTime()` methods to format the column's state using [PHP date formatting tokens](https://www.php.net/manual/en/datetime.format.php):

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('created_at')
    ->dateTime()
```

You may use the `since()` method to format the column's state using [Carbon's `diffForHumans()`](https://carbon.nesbot.com/docs/#api-humandiff):

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('created_at')
    ->since()
```

Additionally, you can use the `dateTooltip()`, `dateTimeTooltip()` or `timeTooltip()` method to display a formatted date in a tooltip, often to provide extra information:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('created_at')
    ->since()
    ->dateTimeTooltip()
```

## Number formatting

The `numeric()` method allows you to format an entry as a number:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('stock')
    ->numeric()
```

If you would like to customize the number of decimal places used to format the number with, you can use the `decimalPlaces` argument:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('stock')
    ->numeric(decimalPlaces: 0)
```

By default, your app's locale will be used to format the number suitably. If you would like to customize the locale used, you can pass it to the `locale` argument:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('stock')
    ->numeric(locale: 'nl')
```

Alternatively, you can set the default locale used across your app using the `Table::$defaultNumberLocale` method in the `boot()` method of a service provider:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

Table::$defaultNumberLocale = 'nl';
```

## Currency formatting

The `money()` method allows you to easily format monetary values, in any currency:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('price')
    ->money('EUR')
```

There is also a `divideBy` argument for `money()` that allows you to divide the original value by a number before formatting it. This could be useful if your database stores the price in cents, for example:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('price')
    ->money('EUR', divideBy: 100)
```

By default, your app's locale will be used to format the money suitably. If you would like to customize the locale used, you can pass it to the `locale` argument:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('price')
    ->money('EUR', locale: 'nl')
```

Alternatively, you can set the default locale used across your app using the `Table::$defaultNumberLocale` method in the `boot()` method of a service provider:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

Table::$defaultNumberLocale = 'nl';
```

## Limiting text length

You may `limit()` the length of the cell's value:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('description')
    ->limit(50)
```

You may also reuse the value that is being passed to `limit()`:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('description')
    ->limit(50)
    ->tooltip(function (TextColumn $column): ?string {
        $state = $column->getState();

        if (strlen($state) <= $column->getCharacterLimit()) {
            return null;
        }

        // Only render the tooltip if the column content exceeds the length limit.
        return $state;
    })
```

## Limiting word count

You may limit the number of `words()` displayed in the cell:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('description')
    ->words(10)
```

## Limiting text to a specific number of lines

You may want to limit text to a specific number of lines instead of limiting it to a fixed length. Clamping text to a number of lines is useful in responsive interfaces where you want to ensure a consistent experience across all screen sizes. This can be achieved using the `lineClamp()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('description')
    ->lineClamp(2)
```

## Adding a prefix or suffix

You may add a prefix or suffix to the cell's value:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('domain')
    ->prefix('https://')
    ->suffix('.com')
```

## Wrapping content

If you'd like your column's content to wrap if it's too long, you may use the `wrap()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('description')
    ->wrap()
```

## Listing multiple values

By default, if there are multiple values inside your text column, they will be comma-separated. You may use the `listWithLineBreaks()` method to display them on new lines instead:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('authors.name')
    ->listWithLineBreaks()
```

### Adding bullet points to the list

You may add a bullet point to each list item using the `bulleted()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('authors.name')
    ->listWithLineBreaks()
    ->bulleted()
```

### Limiting the number of values in the list

You can limit the number of values in the list using the `limitList()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('authors.name')
    ->listWithLineBreaks()
    ->limitList(3)
```

#### Expanding the limited list

You can allow the limited items to be expanded and collapsed, using the `expandableLimitedList()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('authors.name')
    ->listWithLineBreaks()
    ->limitList(3)
    ->expandableLimitedList()
```

Please note that this is only a feature for `listWithLineBreaks()` or `bulleted()`, where each item is on its own line.

### Using a list separator

If you want to "explode" a text string from your model into multiple list items, you can do so with the `separator()` method. This is useful for displaying comma-separated tags [as badges](#displaying-as-a-badge), for example:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('tags')
    ->badge()
    ->separator(',')
```

## Rendering HTML

If your column value is HTML, you may render it using `html()`:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('description')
    ->html()
```

If you use this method, then the HTML will be sanitized to remove any potentially unsafe content before it is rendered. If you'd like to opt out of this behavior, you can wrap the HTML in an `HtmlString` object by formatting it:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;
use Illuminate\Support\HtmlString;

TextColumn::make('description')
    ->formatStateUsing(fn (string $state): HtmlString => new HtmlString($state))
```

Or, you can return a `view()` object from the `formatStateUsing()` method, which will also not be sanitized:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;
use Illuminate\Contracts\View\View;

TextColumn::make('description')
    ->formatStateUsing(fn (string $state): View => view(
        'filament.tables.columns.description-entry-content',
        ['state' => $state],
    ))
```

### Rendering Markdown as HTML

If your column contains Markdown, you may render it using `markdown()`:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('description')
    ->markdown()
```

## Custom formatting

You may instead pass a custom formatting callback to `formatStateUsing()`, which accepts the `$state` of the cell, and optionally its `$record`:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('status')
    ->formatStateUsing(fn (string $state): string => __("statuses.{$state}"))
```

## Customizing the color

You may set a color for the text, either `danger`, `gray`, `info`, `primary`, `success` or `warning`:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('status')
    ->color('primary')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/text/color" alt="Text column in the primary color" version="3.x" />

## Adding an icon

Text columns may also have an icon:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('email')
    ->icon('heroicon-m-envelope')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/text/icon" alt="Text column with icon" version="3.x" />

You may set the position of an icon using `iconPosition()`:

```php
use Filament\Support\Enums\IconPosition;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('email')
    ->icon('heroicon-m-envelope')
    ->iconPosition(IconPosition::After) // `IconPosition::Before` or `IconPosition::After`
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/text/icon-after" alt="Text column with icon after" version="3.x" />

The icon color defaults to the text color, but you may customize the icon color separately using `iconColor()`:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('email')
    ->icon('heroicon-m-envelope')
    ->iconColor('primary')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/text/icon-color" alt="Text column with icon in the primary color" version="3.x" />

## Customizing the text size

Text columns have small font size by default, but you may change this to `TextColumnSize::ExtraSmall`, `TextColumnSize::Medium`, or `TextColumnSize::Large`.

For instance, you may make the text larger using `size(TextColumnSize::Large)`:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('title')
    ->size(TextColumn\TextColumnSize::Large)
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/text/large" alt="Text column in a large font size" version="3.x" />

## Customizing the font weight

Text columns have regular font weight by default, but you may change this to any of the following options: `FontWeight::Thin`, `FontWeight::ExtraLight`, `FontWeight::Light`, `FontWeight::Medium`, `FontWeight::SemiBold`, `FontWeight::Bold`, `FontWeight::ExtraBold` or `FontWeight::Black`.

For instance, you may make the font bold using `weight(FontWeight::Bold)`:

```php
use Filament\Support\Enums\FontWeight;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('title')
    ->weight(FontWeight::Bold)
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/text/bold" alt="Text column in a bold font" version="3.x" />

## Customizing the font family

You can change the text font family to any of the following options: `FontFamily::Sans`, `FontFamily::Serif` or `FontFamily::Mono`.

For instance, you may make the font mono using `fontFamily(FontFamily::Mono)`:

```php
use Filament\Support\Enums\FontFamily;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('email')
    ->fontFamily(FontFamily::Mono)
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/text/mono" alt="Text column in a monospaced font" version="3.x" />

## Allowing the text to be copied to the clipboard

You may make the text copyable, such that clicking on the cell copies the text to the clipboard, and optionally specify a custom confirmation message and duration in milliseconds. This feature only works when SSL is enabled for the app.

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('email')
    ->copyable()
    ->copyMessage('Email address copied')
    ->copyMessageDuration(1500)
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/text/copyable" alt="Text column with a button to copy it" version="3.x" />

### Customizing the text that is copied to the clipboard

You can customize the text that gets copied to the clipboard using the `copyableState()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('url')
    ->copyable()
    ->copyableState(fn (string $state): string => "URL: {$state}")
```

In this function, you can access the whole table row with `$record`:

```php
use App\Models\Post;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('url')
    ->copyable()
    ->copyableState(fn (Post $record): string => "URL: {$record->url}")
```

## Displaying the row index

You may want a column to contain the number of the current row in the table:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;
use Filament\Tables\Contracts\HasTable;

TextColumn::make('index')->state(
    static function (HasTable $livewire, stdClass $rowLoop): string {
        return (string) (
            $rowLoop->iteration +
            ($livewire->getTableRecordsPerPage() * (
                $livewire->getTablePage() - 1
            ))
        );
    }
),
```

As `$rowLoop` is [Laravel Blade's `$loop` object](https://laravel.com/docs/blade#the-loop-variable), you can reference all other `$loop` properties.

As a shortcut, you may use the `rowIndex()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('index')
    ->rowIndex()
```

To start counting from 0 instead of 1, use `isFromZero: true`:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('index')
    ->rowIndex(isFromZero: true)
```

# Documentation for tables. File: 03-columns/03-icon.md
---
title: Icon column
---
import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"

## Overview

Icon columns render an [icon](https://blade-ui-kit.com/blade-icons?set=1#search) representing their contents:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\IconColumn;

IconColumn::make('status')
    ->icon(fn (string $state): string => match ($state) {
        'draft' => 'heroicon-o-pencil',
        'reviewing' => 'heroicon-o-clock',
        'published' => 'heroicon-o-check-circle',
    })
```

In the function, `$state` is the value of the column, and `$record` can be used to access the underlying Eloquent record.

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/icon/simple" alt="Icon column" version="3.x" />

## Customizing the color

Icon columns may also have a set of icon colors, using the same syntax. They may be either `danger`, `gray`, `info`, `primary`, `success` or `warning`:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\IconColumn;

IconColumn::make('status')
    ->color(fn (string $state): string => match ($state) {
        'draft' => 'info',
        'reviewing' => 'warning',
        'published' => 'success',
        default => 'gray',
    })
```

In the function, `$state` is the value of the column, and `$record` can be used to access the underlying Eloquent record.

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/icon/color" alt="Icon column with color" version="3.x" />

## Customizing the size

The default icon size is `IconColumnSize::Large`, but you may customize the size to be either `IconColumnSize::ExtraSmall`, `IconColumnSize::Small`, `IconColumnSize::Medium`, `IconColumnSize::ExtraLarge` or `IconColumnSize::TwoExtraLarge`:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\IconColumn;

IconColumn::make('status')
    ->size(IconColumn\IconColumnSize::Medium)
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/icon/medium" alt="Medium-sized icon column" version="3.x" />

## Handling booleans

Icon columns can display a check or cross icon based on the contents of the database column, either true or false, using the `boolean()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\IconColumn;

IconColumn::make('is_featured')
    ->boolean()
```

> If this column in the model class is already cast as a `bool` or `boolean`, Filament is able to detect this, and you do not need to use `boolean()` manually.

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/icon/boolean" alt="Icon column to display a boolean" version="3.x" />

### Customizing the boolean icons

You may customize the icon representing each state. Icons are the name of a Blade component present. By default, [Heroicons](https://heroicons.com) are installed:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\IconColumn;

IconColumn::make('is_featured')
    ->boolean()
    ->trueIcon('heroicon-o-check-badge')
    ->falseIcon('heroicon-o-x-mark')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/icon/boolean-icon" alt="Icon column to display a boolean with custom icons" version="3.x" />

### Customizing the boolean colors

You may customize the icon color representing each state. These may be either `danger`, `gray`, `info`, `primary`, `success` or `warning`:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\IconColumn;

IconColumn::make('is_featured')
    ->boolean()
    ->trueColor('info')
    ->falseColor('warning')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/icon/boolean-color" alt="Icon column to display a boolean with custom colors" version="3.x" />

## Wrapping multiple icons

When displaying multiple icons, they can be set to wrap if they can't fit on one line, using `wrap()`:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\IconColumn;

IconColumn::make('icon')
    ->wrap()
```

Note: the "width" for wrapping is affected by the column label, so you may need to use a shorter or hidden label to wrap more tightly.


# Documentation for tables. File: 03-columns/04-image.md
---
title: Image column
---
import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"

## Overview

Images can be easily displayed within your table:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ImageColumn;

ImageColumn::make('avatar')
```

The column in the database must contain the path to the image, relative to the root directory of its storage disk.

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/image/simple" alt="Image column" version="3.x" />

## Managing the image disk

By default, the `public` disk will be used to retrieve images. You may pass a custom disk name to the `disk()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ImageColumn;

ImageColumn::make('header_image')
    ->disk('s3')
```

## Private images

Filament can generate temporary URLs to render private images, you may set the `visibility()` to `private`:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ImageColumn;

ImageColumn::make('header_image')
    ->visibility('private')
```

## Customizing the size

You may customize the image size by passing a `width()` and `height()`, or both with `size()`:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ImageColumn;

ImageColumn::make('header_image')
    ->width(200)

ImageColumn::make('header_image')
    ->height(50)

ImageColumn::make('author.avatar')
    ->size(40)
```

## Square image

You may display the image using a 1:1 aspect ratio:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ImageColumn;

ImageColumn::make('avatar')
    ->square()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/image/square" alt="Square image column" version="3.x" />

## Circular image

You may make the image fully rounded, which is useful for rendering avatars:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ImageColumn;

ImageColumn::make('avatar')
    ->circular()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/image/circular" alt="Circular image column" version="3.x" />

## Adding a default image URL

You can display a placeholder image if one doesn't exist yet, by passing a URL to the `defaultImageUrl()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ImageColumn;

ImageColumn::make('avatar')
    ->defaultImageUrl(url('/images/placeholder.png'))
```

## Stacking images

You may display multiple images as a stack of overlapping images by using `stacked()`:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ImageColumn;

ImageColumn::make('colleagues.avatar')
    ->circular()
    ->stacked()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/image/stacked" alt="Stacked image column" version="3.x" />

### Customizing the stacked ring width

The default ring width is `3`, but you may customize it to be from `0` to `8`:

```php
ImageColumn::make('colleagues.avatar')
    ->circular()
    ->stacked()
    ->ring(5)
```

### Customizing the stacked overlap

The default overlap is `4`, but you may customize it to be from `0` to `8`:

```php
ImageColumn::make('colleagues.avatar')
    ->circular()
    ->stacked()
    ->overlap(2)
```

## Wrapping multiple images

Images can be set to wrap if they can't fit on one line, by setting `wrap()`:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ImageColumn;

ImageColumn::make('colleagues.avatar')
    ->circular()
    ->stacked()
    ->wrap()
```

Note: the "width" for wrapping is affected by the column label, so you may need to use a shorter or hidden label to wrap more tightly.

## Setting a limit

You may limit the maximum number of images you want to display by passing `limit()`:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ImageColumn;

ImageColumn::make('colleagues.avatar')
    ->circular()
    ->stacked()
    ->limit(3)
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/image/limited" alt="Limited image column" version="3.x" />

### Showing the remaining images count

When you set a limit you may also display the count of remaining images by passing `limitedRemainingText()`. 

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ImageColumn;

ImageColumn::make('colleagues.avatar')
    ->circular()
    ->stacked()
    ->limit(3)
    ->limitedRemainingText()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/image/limited-remaining-text" alt="Limited image column with remaining text" version="3.x" />

#### Showing the limited remaining text separately

By default, `limitedRemainingText()` will display the count of remaining images as a number stacked on the other images. If you prefer to show the count as a number after the images, you may use the `isSeparate: true` parameter:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ImageColumn;

ImageColumn::make('colleagues.avatar')
    ->circular()
    ->stacked()
    ->limit(3)
    ->limitedRemainingText(isSeparate: true)
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/image/limited-remaining-text-separately" alt="Limited image column with remaining text separately" version="3.x" />

#### Customizing the limited remaining text size

By default, the size of the remaining text is `sm`. You can customize this to be `xs`, `md` or `lg` using the `size` parameter:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ImageColumn;

ImageColumn::make('colleagues.avatar')
    ->circular()
    ->stacked()
    ->limit(3)
    ->limitedRemainingText(size: 'lg')
```

## Custom attributes

You may customize the extra HTML attributes of the image using `extraImgAttributes()`:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ImageColumn;

ImageColumn::make('logo')
    ->extraImgAttributes(['loading' => 'lazy']),
```

You can access the current record using a `$record` parameter:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ImageColumn;

ImageColumn::make('logo')
    ->extraImgAttributes(fn (Company $record): array => [
        'alt' => "{$record->name} logo",
    ]),
```

## Prevent file existence checks

When the table is loaded, it will automatically detect whether the images exist. This is all done on the backend. When using remote storage with many images, this can be time-consuming. You can use the `checkFileExistence(false)` method to disable this feature:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ImageColumn;

ImageColumn::make('attachment')
    ->checkFileExistence(false)
```

# Documentation for tables. File: 03-columns/05-color.md
---
title: Color column
---
import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"

## Overview

The color column allows you to show the color preview from a CSS color definition, typically entered using the color picker field, in one of the supported formats (HEX, HSL, RGB, RGBA).

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ColorColumn;

ColorColumn::make('color')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/color/simple" alt="Color column" version="3.x" />

## Allowing the color to be copied to the clipboard

You may make the color copyable, such that clicking on the preview copies the CSS value to the clipboard, and optionally specify a custom confirmation message and duration in milliseconds. This feature only works when SSL is enabled for the app.

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ColorColumn;

ColorColumn::make('color')
    ->copyable()
    ->copyMessage('Color code copied')
    ->copyMessageDuration(1500)
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/color/copyable" alt="Color column with a button to copy it" version="3.x" />

### Customizing the text that is copied to the clipboard

You can customize the text that gets copied to the clipboard using the `copyableState()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ColorColumn;

ColorColumn::make('color')
    ->copyable()
    ->copyableState(fn (string $state): string => "Color: {$state}")
```

In this function, you can access the whole table row with `$record`:

```php
use App\Models\Post;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ColorColumn;

ColorColumn::make('color')
    ->copyable()
    ->copyableState(fn (Post $record): string => "Color: {$record->color}")
```

## Wrapping multiple color blocks

Color blocks can be set to wrap if they can't fit on one line, by setting `wrap()`:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ColorColumn;

ColorColumn::make('color')
    ->wrap()
```

Note: the "width" for wrapping is affected by the column label, so you may need to use a shorter or hidden label to wrap more tightly.


# Documentation for tables. File: 03-columns/06-select.md
---
title: Select column
---
import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"

## Overview

The select column allows you to render a select field inside the table, which can be used to update that database record without needing to open a new page or a modal.

You must pass options to the column:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\SelectColumn;

SelectColumn::make('status')
    ->options([
        'draft' => 'Draft',
        'reviewing' => 'Reviewing',
        'published' => 'Published',
    ])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/select/simple" alt="Select column" version="3.x" />

## Validation

You can validate the input by passing any [Laravel validation rules](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#available-validation-rules) in an array:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\SelectColumn;

SelectColumn::make('status')
    ->options([
        'draft' => 'Draft',
        'reviewing' => 'Reviewing',
        'published' => 'Published',
    ])
    ->rules(['required'])
```

## Disabling placeholder selection

You can prevent the placeholder from being selected using the `selectablePlaceholder()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\SelectColumn;

SelectColumn::make('status')
    ->options([
        'draft' => 'Draft',
        'reviewing' => 'Reviewing',
        'published' => 'Published',
    ])
    ->selectablePlaceholder(false)
```

## Lifecycle hooks

Hooks may be used to execute code at various points within the select's lifecycle:

```php
SelectColumn::make()
    ->beforeStateUpdated(function ($record, $state) {
        // Runs before the state is saved to the database.
    })
    ->afterStateUpdated(function ($record, $state) {
        // Runs after the state is saved to the database.
    })
```

# Documentation for tables. File: 03-columns/07-toggle.md
---
title: Toggle column
---
import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"

## Overview

The toggle column allows you to render a toggle button inside the table, which can be used to update that database record without needing to open a new page or a modal:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ToggleColumn;

ToggleColumn::make('is_admin')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/toggle/simple" alt="Toggle column" version="3.x" />

## Lifecycle hooks

Hooks may be used to execute code at various points within the toggle's lifecycle:

```php
ToggleColumn::make()
    ->beforeStateUpdated(function ($record, $state) {
        // Runs before the state is saved to the database.
    })
    ->afterStateUpdated(function ($record, $state) {
        // Runs after the state is saved to the database.
    })
```

# Documentation for tables. File: 03-columns/08-text-input.md

title: Text input column
---
import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"

## Overview

The text input column allows you to render a text input inside the table, which can be used to update that database record without needing to open a new page or a modal:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextInputColumn;

TextInputColumn::make('email')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/columns/text-input/simple" alt="Text input column" version="3.x" />

## Validation

You can validate the input by passing any [Laravel validation rules](https://laravel.com/docs/validation#available-validation-rules) in an array:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextInputColumn;

TextInputColumn::make('name')
    ->rules(['required', 'max:255'])
```

## Customizing the HTML input type

You may use the `type()` method to pass a custom [HTML input type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input#input_types):

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextInputColumn;

TextInputColumn::make('background_color')->type('color')
```

## Lifecycle hooks

Hooks may be used to execute code at various points within the input's lifecycle:

```php
TextInputColumn::make()
    ->beforeStateUpdated(function ($record, $state) {
        // Runs before the state is saved to the database.
    })
    ->afterStateUpdated(function ($record, $state) {
        // Runs after the state is saved to the database.
    })
```

## Overview

The checkbox column allows you to render a checkbox inside the table, which can be used to update that database record without needing to open a new page or a modal:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\CheckboxColumn;

CheckboxColumn::make('is_admin')
```

## View columns

You may render a custom view for a cell using the `view()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ViewColumn;

ViewColumn::make('status')->view('filament.tables.columns.status-switcher')
```

This assumes that you have a `resources/views/filament/tables/columns/status-switcher.blade.php` file.

## Custom classes

You may create your own custom column classes and cell views, which you can reuse across your project, and even release as a plugin to the community.

> If you're just creating a simple custom column to use once, you could instead use a [view column](#view-columns) to render any custom Blade file.

To create a custom column class and view, you may use the following command:

```bash
php artisan make:table-column StatusSwitcher
```

This will create the following column class:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Column;

class StatusSwitcher extends Column
{
    protected string $view = 'filament.tables.columns.status-switcher';
}
```

It will also create a view file at `resources/views/filament/tables/columns/status-switcher.blade.php`.

## Accessing the state

Inside your view, you may retrieve the state of the cell using the `$getState()` function:

```blade
<div>
    {{ $getState() }}
</div>
```

## Accessing the Eloquent record

Inside your view, you may access the Eloquent record using the `$getRecord()` function:

```blade
<div>
    {{ $getRecord()->name }}
</div>
```

# Documentation for tables. File: 03-columns/11-relationships.md
---
title: Column relationships
---

## Displaying data from relationships

You may use "dot notation" to access columns within relationships. The name of the relationship comes first, followed by a period, followed by the name of the column to display:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('author.name')
```

## Counting relationships

If you wish to count the number of related records in a column, you may use the `counts()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('users_count')->counts('users')
```

In this example, `users` is the name of the relationship to count from. The name of the column must be `users_count`, as this is the convention that [Laravel uses](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-relationships#counting-related-models) for storing the result.

If you'd like to scope the relationship before calculating, you can pass an array to the method, where the key is the relationship name and the value is the function to scope the Eloquent query with:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

TextColumn::make('users_count')->counts([
    'users' => fn (Builder $query) => $query->where('is_active', true),
])
```

## Determining relationship existence

If you simply wish to indicate whether related records exist in a column, you may use the `exists()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('users_exists')->exists('users')
```

In this example, `users` is the name of the relationship to check for existence. The name of the column must be `users_exists`, as this is the convention that [Laravel uses](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-relationships#other-aggregate-functions) for storing the result.

If you'd like to scope the relationship before calculating, you can pass an array to the method, where the key is the relationship name and the value is the function to scope the Eloquent query with:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

TextColumn::make('users_exists')->exists([
    'users' => fn (Builder $query) => $query->where('is_active', true),
])
```

## Aggregating relationships

Filament provides several methods for aggregating a relationship field, including `avg()`, `max()`, `min()` and `sum()`. For instance, if you wish to show the average of a field on all related records in a column, you may use the `avg()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('users_avg_age')->avg('users', 'age')
```

In this example, `users` is the name of the relationship, while `age` is the field that is being averaged. The name of the column must be `users_avg_age`, as this is the convention that [Laravel uses](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent-relationships#other-aggregate-functions) for storing the result.

If you'd like to scope the relationship before calculating, you can pass an array to the method, where the key is the relationship name and the value is the function to scope the Eloquent query with:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

TextColumn::make('users_avg_age')->avg([
    'users' => fn (Builder $query) => $query->where('is_active', true),
], 'age')
```

## Table column utility injection

The vast majority of methods used to configure columns accept functions as parameters instead of hardcoded values:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('status')
    ->color(fn (string $state): string => match ($state) {
        'draft' => 'gray',
        'reviewing' => 'warning',
        'published' => 'success',
        'rejected' => 'danger',
    })
```

This alone unlocks many customization possibilities.

The package is also able to inject many utilities to use inside these functions, as parameters. All customization methods that accept functions as arguments can inject utilities.

These injected utilities require specific parameter names to be used. Otherwise, Filament doesn't know what to inject.

### Injecting the current state of a column

If you wish to access the current state (value) of the column, define a `$state` parameter:

```php
function ($state) {
    // ...
}
```

### Injecting the current Eloquent record

If you wish to access the current Eloquent record of the column, define a `$record` parameter:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

function (Model $record) {
    // ...
}
```

Be aware that this parameter will be `null` if the column is not bound to an Eloquent record. For instance, the `label()` method of a column will not have access to the record, as the label is not related to any table row.

### Injecting the current column instance

If you wish to access the current column instance, define a `$column` parameter:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Column;

function (Column $column) {
    // ...
}
```

### Injecting the current Livewire component instance

If you wish to access the current Livewire component instance that the table belongs to, define a `$livewire` parameter:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Contracts\HasTable;

function (HasTable $livewire) {
    // ...
}
```

### Injecting the current table instance

If you wish to access the current table configuration instance that the column belongs to, define a `$table` parameter:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

function (Table $table) {
    // ...
}
```

### Injecting the current table row loop

If you wish to access the current [Laravel Blade loop object](https://laravel.com/docs/blade#the-loop-variable) that the column is rendered part of, define a `$rowLoop` parameter:

```php
function (stdClass $rowLoop) {
    // ...
}
```

As `$rowLoop` is [Laravel Blade's `$loop` object](https://laravel.com/docs/blade#the-loop-variable), you can access the current row index using `$rowLoop->index`. Similar to `$record`, this parameter will be `null` if the column is currently being rendered outside a table row.

### Injecting multiple utilities

The parameters are injected dynamically using reflection, so you are able to combine multiple parameters in any order:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Contracts\HasTable;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

function (HasTable $livewire, Model $record) {
    // ...
}
```

### Injecting dependencies from Laravel's container

You may inject anything from Laravel's container like normal, alongside utilities:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

function (Request $request, Model $record) {
    // ...
}
```

## Overview

<LaracastsBanner
    title="Table Filters"
    description="Watch the Rapid Laravel Development with Filament series on Laracasts - it will teach you the basics of adding filters to Filament resource tables."
    url="https://laracasts.com/series/rapid-laravel-development-with-filament/episodes/10"
    series="rapid-laravel-development"
/>

Filters allow you to define certain constraints on your data, and allow users to scope it to find the information they need. You put them in the `$table->filters()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->filters([
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/filters/simple" alt="Table with filter" version="3.x" />

Filters may be created using the static `make()` method, passing its unique name. You should then pass a callback to `query()` which applies your filter's scope:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\Filter;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

Filter::make('is_featured')
    ->query(fn (Builder $query): Builder => $query->where('is_featured', true))
```

## Available filters

By default, using the `Filter::make()` method will render a checkbox form component. When the checkbox is on, the `query()` will be activated.

- You can also [replace the checkbox with a toggle](#using-a-toggle-button-instead-of-a-checkbox).
- You can use a [ternary filter](ternary) to replace the checkbox with a select field to allow users to pick between 3 states - usually "true", "false" and "blank". This is useful for filtering boolean columns that are nullable.
- The [trashed filter](ternary#filtering-soft-deletable-records) is a pre-built ternary filter that allows you to filter soft-deletable records.
- You may use a [select filter](select) to allow users to select from a list of options, and filter using the selection.
- You may use a [query builder](query-builder) to allow users to create complex sets of filters, with an advanced user interface for combining constraints.
- You may build [custom filters](custom) with other form fields, to do whatever you want.

## Setting a label

By default, the label of the filter, which is displayed in the filter form, is generated from the name of the filter. You may customize this using the `label()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\Filter;

Filter::make('is_featured')
    ->label('Featured')
```

Optionally, you can have the label automatically translated [using Laravel's localization features](https://laravel.com/docs/localization) with the `translateLabel()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\Filter;

Filter::make('is_featured')
    ->translateLabel() // Equivalent to `label(__('Is featured'))`
```

## Customizing the filter form

By default, creating a filter with the `Filter` class will render a [checkbox form component](../../forms/fields/checkbox). When the checkbox is checked, the `query()` function will be applied to the table's query, scoping the records in the table. When the checkbox is unchecked, the `query()` function will be removed from the table's query.

Filters are built entirely on Filament's form fields. They can render any combination of form fields, which users can then interact with to filter the table.

### Using a toggle button instead of a checkbox

The simplest example of managing the form field that is used for a filter is to replace the [checkbox](../../forms/fields/checkbox) with a [toggle button](../../forms/fields/toggle), using the `toggle()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\Filter;

Filter::make('is_featured')
    ->toggle()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/filters/toggle" alt="Table with toggle filter" version="3.x" />

### Applying the filter by default

You may set a filter to be enabled by default, using the `default()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\Filter;

Filter::make('is_featured')
    ->default()
```

### Customizing the built-in filter form field

Whether you are using a checkbox, a [toggle](#using-a-toggle-button-instead-of-a-checkbox) or a [select](select), you can customize the built-in form field used for the filter, using the `modifyFormFieldUsing()` method. The method accepts a function with a `$field` parameter that gives you access to the form field object to customize:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Checkbox;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\Filter;

Filter::make('is_featured')
    ->modifyFormFieldUsing(fn (Checkbox $field) => $field->inline(false))
```

## Persist filters in session

To persist the table filters in the user's session, use the `persistFiltersInSession()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->filters([
            // ...
        ])
        ->persistFiltersInSession();
}
```

## Deferring filters

You can defer filter changes from affecting the table, until the user clicks an "Apply" button. To do this, use the `deferFilters()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->filters([
            // ...
        ])
        ->deferFilters();
}
```

### Customizing the apply filters action

When deferring filters, you can customize the "Apply" button, using the `filtersApplyAction()` method, passing a closure that returns an action. All methods that are available to [customize action trigger buttons](../../actions/trigger-button) can be used:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->filters([
            // ...
        ])
        ->filtersApplyAction(
            fn (Action $action) => $action
                ->link()
                ->label('Save filters to table'),
        );
}
```

## Deselecting records when filters change

By default, all records will be deselected when the filters change. Using the `deselectAllRecordsWhenFiltered(false)` method, you can disable this behavior:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->filters([
            // ...
        ])
        ->deselectAllRecordsWhenFiltered(false);
}
```

## Modifying the base query

By default, modifications to the Eloquent query performed in the `query()` method will be applied inside a scoped `where()` clause. This is to ensure that the query does not clash with any other filters that may be applied, especially those that use `orWhere()`.

However, the downside of this is that the `query()` method cannot be used to modify the query in other ways, such as removing global scopes, since the base query needs to be modified directly, not the scoped query.

To modify the base query directly, you may use the `baseQuery()` method, passing a closure that receives the base query:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\SoftDeletingScope;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\TernaryFilter;

TernaryFilter::make('trashed')
    // ...
    ->baseQuery(fn (Builder $query) => $query->withoutGlobalScopes([
        SoftDeletingScope::class,
    ]))
```

## Customizing the filters trigger action

To customize the filters trigger buttons, you may use the `filtersTriggerAction()` method, passing a closure that returns an action. All methods that are available to [customize action trigger buttons](../../actions/trigger-button) can be used:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->filters([
            // ...
        ])
        ->filtersTriggerAction(
            fn (Action $action) => $action
                ->button()
                ->label('Filter'),
        );
}
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/filters/custom-trigger-action" alt="Table with custom filters trigger action" version="3.x" />

## Table filter utility injection

The vast majority of methods used to configure filters accept functions as parameters instead of hardcoded values:

```php
use App\Models\Author;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\SelectFilter;

SelectFilter::make('author')
    ->options(fn (): array => Author::query()->pluck('name', 'id')->all())
```

This alone unlocks many customization possibilities.

The package is also able to inject many utilities to use inside these functions, as parameters. All customization methods that accept functions as arguments can inject utilities.

These injected utilities require specific parameter names to be used. Otherwise, Filament doesn't know what to inject.

### Injecting the current filter instance

If you wish to access the current filter instance, define a `$filter` parameter:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\BaseFilter;

function (BaseFilter $filter) {
    // ...
}
```

### Injecting the current Livewire component instance

If you wish to access the current Livewire component instance that the table belongs to, define a `$livewire` parameter:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Contracts\HasTable;

function (HasTable $livewire) {
    // ...
}
```

### Injecting the current table instance

If you wish to access the current table configuration instance that the filter belongs to, define a `$table` parameter:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

function (Table $table) {
    // ...
}
```

### Injecting multiple utilities

The parameters are injected dynamically using reflection, so you are able to combine multiple parameters in any order:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Contracts\HasTable;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

function (HasTable $livewire, Table $table) {
    // ...
}
```

### Injecting dependencies from Laravel's container

You may inject anything from Laravel's container like normal, alongside utilities:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

function (Request $request, Table $table) {
    // ...
}
```

import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"
import LaracastsBanner from "@components/LaracastsBanner.astro"

## Overview

Often, you will want to use a [select field](../../forms/fields/select) instead of a checkbox. This is especially true when you want to filter a column based on a set of pre-defined options that the user can choose from. To do this, you can create a filter using the `SelectFilter` class:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\SelectFilter;

SelectFilter::make('status')
    ->options([
        'draft' => 'Draft',
        'reviewing' => 'Reviewing',
        'published' => 'Published',
    ])
```

The `options()` that are passed to the filter are the same as those that are passed to the [select field](../../forms/fields/select).

## Customizing the column used by a select filter

Select filters do not require a custom `query()` method. The column name used to scope the query is the name of the filter. To customize this, you may use the `attribute()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\SelectFilter;

SelectFilter::make('status')
    ->options([
        'draft' => 'Draft',
        'reviewing' => 'Reviewing',
        'published' => 'Published',
    ])
    ->attribute('status_id')
```

## Multi-select filters

These allow the user to select multiple options to apply the filter to their table. For example, a status filter may present the user with a few status options to pick from and filter the table using. When the user selects multiple options, the table will be filtered to show records that match any of the selected options. You can enable this behavior using the `multiple()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\SelectFilter;

SelectFilter::make('status')
    ->multiple()
    ->options([
        'draft' => 'Draft',
        'reviewing' => 'Reviewing',
        'published' => 'Published',
    ])
```

## Relationship select filters

Select filters are also able to automatically populate themselves based on a relationship. For example, if your table has a `author` relationship with a `name` column, you may use `relationship()` to filter the records belonging to an author:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\SelectFilter;

SelectFilter::make('author')
    ->relationship('author', 'name')
```

### Preloading the select filter relationship options

If you'd like to populate the searchable options from the database when the page is loaded, instead of when the user searches, you can use the `preload()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\SelectFilter;

SelectFilter::make('author')
    ->relationship('author', 'name')
    ->searchable()
    ->preload()
```

### Customizing the select filter relationship query

You may customize the database query that retrieves options using the third parameter of the `relationship()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\SelectFilter;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

SelectFilter::make('author')
    ->relationship('author', 'name', fn (Builder $query) => $query->withTrashed())
```

### Searching select filter options

You may enable a search input to allow easier access to many options, using the `searchable()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\SelectFilter;

SelectFilter::make('author')
    ->relationship('author', 'name')
    ->searchable()
```

## Disable placeholder selection

You can remove the placeholder (null option), which disables the filter so all options are applied, using the `selectablePlaceholder()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\SelectFilter;

SelectFilter::make('status')
    ->options([
        'draft' => 'Draft',
        'reviewing' => 'Reviewing',
        'published' => 'Published',
    ])
    ->default('draft')
    ->selectablePlaceholder(false)
```

## Applying select filters by default

You may set a select filter to be enabled by default, using the `default()` method. If using a single select filter, the `default()` method accepts a single option value. If using a `multiple()` select filter, the `default()` method accepts an array of option values:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\SelectFilter;

SelectFilter::make('status')
    ->options([
        'draft' => 'Draft',
        'reviewing' => 'Reviewing',
        'published' => 'Published',
    ])
    ->default('draft')

SelectFilter::make('status')
    ->options([
        'draft' => 'Draft',
        'reviewing' => 'Reviewing',
        'published' => 'Published',
    ])
    ->multiple()
    ->default(['draft', 'reviewing'])
```


# Documentation for tables. File: 04-filters/03-ternary.md
---
title: Ternary filters
---

## Overview

Ternary filters allow you to easily create a select filter which has three states - usually true, false and blank. To filter a column named `is_admin` to be `true` or `false`, you may use the ternary filter:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\TernaryFilter;

TernaryFilter::make('is_admin')
```

## Using a ternary filter with a nullable column

Another common pattern is to use a nullable column. For example, when filtering verified and unverified users using the `email_verified_at` column, unverified users have a null timestamp in this column. To apply that logic, you may use the `nullable()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\TernaryFilter;

TernaryFilter::make('email_verified_at')
    ->nullable()
```

## Customizing the column used by a ternary filter

The column name used to scope the query is the name of the filter. To customize this, you may use the `attribute()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\TernaryFilter;

TernaryFilter::make('verified')
    ->nullable()
    ->attribute('status_id')
```

## Customizing the ternary filter option labels

You may customize the labels used for each state of the ternary filter. The true option label can be customized using the `trueLabel()` method. The false option label can be customized using the `falseLabel()` method. The blank (default) option label can be customized using the `placeholder()` method:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\TernaryFilter;

TernaryFilter::make('email_verified_at')
    ->label('Email verification')
    ->nullable()
    ->placeholder('All users')
    ->trueLabel('Verified users')
    ->falseLabel('Not verified users')
```

## Customizing how a ternary filter modifies the query

You may customize how the query changes for each state of the ternary filter, use the `queries()` method:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\TernaryFilter;

TernaryFilter::make('email_verified_at')
    ->label('Email verification')
    ->placeholder('All users')
    ->trueLabel('Verified users')
    ->falseLabel('Not verified users')
    ->queries(
        true: fn (Builder $query) => $query->whereNotNull('email_verified_at'),
        false: fn (Builder $query) => $query->whereNull('email_verified_at'),
        blank: fn (Builder $query) => $query, // In this example, we do not want to filter the query when it is blank.
    )
```

## Filtering soft deletable records

The `TrashedFilter` can be used to filter soft deleted records. It is a type of ternary filter that is built-in to Filament. You can use it like so:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\TrashedFilter;

TrashedFilter::make()
```

# Documentation for tables. File: 04-filters/04-query-builder.md
---
title: Query builder
---

## Overview

The query builder allows you to define a complex set of conditions to filter the data in your table. It is able to handle unlimited nesting of conditions, which you can group together with "and" and "or" operations.

To use it, you need to define a set of "constraints" that will be used to filter the data. Filament includes some built-in constraints, that follow common data types, but you can also define your own custom constraints.

You can add a query builder to any table using the `QueryBuilder` filter:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\BooleanConstraint;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\DateConstraint;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\NumberConstraint;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\RelationshipConstraint;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\RelationshipConstraint\Operators\IsRelatedToOperator;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\SelectConstraint;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\TextConstraint;

QueryBuilder::make()
    ->constraints([
        TextConstraint::make('name'),
        BooleanConstraint::make('is_visible'),
        NumberConstraint::make('stock'),
        SelectConstraint::make('status')
            ->options([
                'draft' => 'Draft',
                'reviewing' => 'Reviewing',
                'published' => 'Published',
            ])
            ->multiple(),
        DateConstraint::make('created_at'),
        RelationshipConstraint::make('categories')
            ->multiple()
            ->selectable(
                IsRelatedToOperator::make()
                    ->titleAttribute('name')
                    ->searchable()
                    ->multiple(),
            ),
        NumberConstraint::make('reviewsRating')
            ->relationship('reviews', 'rating')
            ->integer(),
    ])
```

When deeply nesting the query builder, you might need to increase the amount of space that the filters can consume. One way of doing this is to [position the filters above the table content](layout#displaying-filters-above-the-table-content):

```php
use Filament\Tables\Enums\FiltersLayout;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->filters([
            QueryBuilder::make()
                ->constraints([
                    // ...
                ]),
        ], layout: FiltersLayout::AboveContent);
}
```

## Available constraints

Filament ships with many different constraints that you can use out of the box. You can also [create your own custom constraints](#creating-custom-constraints):

- [Text constraint](#text-constraints)
- [Boolean constraint](#boolean-constraints)
- [Number constraint](#number-constraints)
- [Date constraint](#date-constraints)
- [Select constraint](#select-constraints)
- [Relationship constraint](#relationship-constraints)

### Text constraints

Text constraints allow you to filter text fields. They can be used to filter any text field, including via relationships.

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\TextConstraint;

TextConstraint::make('name') // Filter the `name` column

TextConstraint::make('creatorName')
    ->relationship(name: 'creator', titleAttribute: 'name') // Filter the `name` column on the `creator` relationship
```

By default, the following operators are available:

- Contains - filters a column to contain the search term
- Does not contain - filters a column to not contain the search term
- Starts with - filters a column to start with the search term
- Does not start with - filters a column to not start with the search term
- Ends with - filters a column to end with the search term
- Does not end with - filters a column to not end with the search term
- Equals - filters a column to equal the search term
- Does not equal - filters a column to not equal the search term
- Is filled - filters a column to not be empty
- Is blank - filters a column to be empty

### Boolean constraints

Boolean constraints allow you to filter boolean fields. They can be used to filter any boolean field, including via relationships.

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\BooleanConstraint;

BooleanConstraint::make('is_visible') // Filter the `is_visible` column

BooleanConstraint::make('creatorIsAdmin')
    ->relationship(name: 'creator', titleAttribute: 'is_admin') // Filter the `is_admin` column on the `creator` relationship
```

By default, the following operators are available:

- Is true - filters a column to be `true`
- Is false - filters a column to be `false`

### Number constraints

Number constraints allow you to filter numeric fields. They can be used to filter any numeric field, including via relationships.

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\NumberConstraint;

NumberConstraint::make('stock') // Filter the `stock` column

NumberConstraint::make('ordersItemCount')
    ->relationship(name: 'orders', titleAttribute: 'item_count') // Filter the `item_count` column on the `orders` relationship
```

By default, the following operators are available:

- Is minimum - filters a column to be greater than or equal to the search number
- Is less than - filters a column to be less than the search number
- Is maximum - filters a column to be less than or equal to the search number
- Is greater than - filters a column to be greater than the search number
- Equals - filters a column to equal the search number
- Does not equal - filters a column to not equal the search number
- Is filled - filters a column to not be empty
- Is blank - filters a column to be empty

When using `relationship()` with a number constraint, users also have the ability to "aggregate" related records. This means that they can filter the column to be the sum, average, minimum or maximum of all the related records at once.

#### Integer constraints

By default, number constraints will allow decimal values. If you'd like to only allow integer values, you can use the `integer()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\NumberConstraint;

NumberConstraint::make('stock')
    ->integer()
```

### Date constraints

Date constraints allow you to filter date fields. They can be used to filter any date field, including via relationships.

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\DateConstraint;

DateConstraint::make('created_at') // Filter the `created_at` column

DateConstraint::make('creatorCreatedAt')
    ->relationship(name: 'creator', titleAttribute: 'created_at') // Filter the `created_at` column on the `creator` relationship
```

By default, the following operators are available:

- Is after - filters a column to be after the search date
- Is not after - filters a column to not be after the search date, or to be the same date
- Is before - filters a column to be before the search date
- Is not before - filters a column to not be before the search date, or to be the same date
- Is date - filters a column to be the same date as the search date
- Is not date - filters a column to not be the same date as the search date
- Is month - filters a column to be in the same month as the selected month
- Is not month - filters a column to not be in the same month as the selected month
- Is year - filters a column to be in the same year as the searched year
- Is not year - filters a column to not be in the same year as the searched year

### Select constraints

Select constraints allow you to filter fields using a select field. They can be used to filter any field, including via relationships.

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\SelectConstraint;

SelectConstraint::make('status') // Filter the `status` column
    ->options([
        'draft' => 'Draft',
        'reviewing' => 'Reviewing',
        'published' => 'Published',
    ])
    
SelectConstraint::make('creatorStatus')
    ->relationship(name: 'creator', titleAttribute: 'department') // Filter the `department` column on the `creator` relationship
    ->options([
        'sales' => 'Sales',
        'marketing' => 'Marketing',
        'engineering' => 'Engineering',
        'purchasing' => 'Purchasing',
    ])
```

#### Searchable select constraints

By default, select constraints will not allow the user to search the options. If you'd like to allow the user to search the options, you can use the `searchable()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\SelectConstraint;

SelectConstraint::make('status')
    ->searchable()
    ->options([
        'draft' => 'Draft',
        'reviewing' => 'Reviewing',
        'published' => 'Published',
    ])
```

#### Multi-select constraints

By default, select constraints will only allow the user to select a single option. If you'd like to allow the user to select multiple options, you can use the `multiple()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\SelectConstraint;

SelectConstraint::make('status')
    ->multiple()
    ->options([
        'draft' => 'Draft',
        'reviewing' => 'Reviewing',
        'published' => 'Published',
    ])
```

When the user selects multiple options, the table will be filtered to show records that match any of the selected options.

### Relationship constraints

Relationship constraints allow you to filter fields using data about a relationship:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\RelationshipConstraint;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\RelationshipConstraint\Operators\IsRelatedToOperator;

RelationshipConstraint::make('creator') // Filter the `creator` relationship
    ->selectable(
        IsRelatedToOperator::make()
            ->titleAttribute('name')
            ->searchable()
            ->multiple(),
    )
```

The `IsRelatedToOperator` is used to configure the "Is / Contains" and "Is not / Does not contain" operators. It provides a select field which allows the user to filter the relationship by which records are attached to it. The `titleAttribute()` method is used to specify which attribute should be used to identify each related record in the list. The `searchable()` method makes the list searchable. The `multiple()` method allows the user to select multiple related records, and if they do, the table will be filtered to show records that match any of the selected related records.

#### Multiple relationships

By default, relationship constraints only include operators that are appropriate for filtering a singular relationship, like a `BelongsTo`. If you have a relationship such as a `HasMany` or `BelongsToMany`, you may wish to mark the constraint as `multiple()`:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\RelationshipConstraint;

RelationshipConstraint::make('categories')
    ->multiple()
```

This will add the following operators to the constraint:

- Has minimum - filters a column to have at least the specified number of related records
- Has less than - filters a column to have less than the specified number of related records
- Has maximum - filters a column to have at most the specified number of related records
- Has more than - filters a column to have more than the specified number of related records
- Has - filters a column to have the specified number of related records
- Does not have - filters a column to not have the specified number of related records

#### Empty relationship constraints

The `RelationshipConstraint` does not support [`nullable()`](#nullable-constraints) in the same way as other constraints.

If the relationship is `multiple()`, then the constraint will show an option to filter out "empty" relationships. This means that the relationship has no related records. If your relationship is singular, then you can use the `emptyable()` method to show an option to filter out "empty" relationships:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\RelationshipConstraint;

RelationshipConstraint::make('creator')
    ->emptyable()
```

If you have a `multiple()` relationship that must always have at least 1 related record, then you can use the `emptyable(false)` method to hide the option to filter out "empty" relationships:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\RelationshipConstraint;

RelationshipConstraint::make('categories')
    ->emptyable(false)
```

#### Nullable constraints

By default, constraints will not show an option to filter `null` values. If you'd like to show an option to filter `null` values, you can use the `nullable()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\TextConstraint;

TextConstraint::make('name')
    ->nullable()
```

Now, the following operators are also available:

- Is filled - filters a column to not be empty
- Is blank - filters a column to be empty

## Scoping relationships

When you use the `relationship()` method on a constraint, you can scope the relationship to filter the related records using the `modifyQueryUsing` argument:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\TextConstraint;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

TextConstraint::make('adminCreatorName')
    ->relationship(
        name: 'creator',
        titleAttribute: 'name',
        modifyQueryUsing: fn (Builder $query) => $query->where('is_admin', true),
    )
```

## Customizing the constraint icon

Each constraint type has a default [icon](https://blade-ui-kit.com/blade-icons?set=1#search), which is displayed next to the label in the picker. You can customize the icon for a constraint by passing its name to the `icon()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\TextConstraint;

TextConstraint::make('author')
    ->relationship(name: 'author', titleAttribute: 'name')
    ->icon('heroicon-m-user')
```

## Overriding the default operators

Each constraint type has a set of default operators, which you can customize by using the `operators()`method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\Operators\IsFilledOperator;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\TextConstraint;

TextConstraint::make('author')
    ->relationship(name: 'author', titleAttribute: 'name')
    ->operators([
        IsFilledOperator::make(),
    ])
```

This will remove all operators, and register the `EqualsOperator`.

If you'd like to add an operator to the end of the list, use `pushOperators()` instead:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\Operators\IsFilledOperator;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\TextConstraint;

TextConstraint::make('author')
    ->relationship(name: 'author', titleAttribute: 'name')
    ->pushOperators([
        IsFilledOperator::class,
    ])
```

If you'd like to add an operator to the start of the list, use `unshiftOperators()` instead:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\Operators\IsFilledOperator;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\TextConstraint;

TextConstraint::make('author')
    ->relationship(name: 'author', titleAttribute: 'name')
    ->unshiftOperators([
        IsFilledOperator::class,
    ])
```

## Creating custom constraints

Custom constraints can be created "inline" with other constraints using the `Constraint::make()` method. You should also pass an [icon](#customizing-the-constraint-icon) to the `icon()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\Constraint;

Constraint::make('subscribed')
    ->icon('heroicon-m-bell')
    ->operators([
        // ...
    ]),
```

If you want to customize the label of the constraint, you can use the `label()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\Constraint;

Constraint::make('subscribed')
    ->label('Subscribed to updates')
    ->icon('heroicon-m-bell')
    ->operators([
        // ...
    ]),
```

Now, you must [define operators](#creating-custom-operators) for the constraint. These are options that you can pick from to filter the column. If the column is [nullable](#nullable-constraints), you can also register that built-in operator for your custom constraint:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\Constraint;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\Operators\IsFilledOperator;

Constraint::make('subscribed')
    ->label('Subscribed to updates')
    ->icon('heroicon-m-bell')
    ->operators([
        // ...
        IsFilledOperator::class,
    ]),
```

### Creating custom operators

Custom operators can be created using the `Operator::make()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder\Constraints\Operators\Operator;

Operator::make('subscribed')
    ->label(fn (bool $isInverse): string => $isInverse ? 'Not subscribed' : 'Subscribed')
    ->summary(fn (bool $isInverse): string => $isInverse ? 'You are not subscribed' : 'You are subscribed')
    ->baseQuery(fn (Builder $query, bool $isInverse) => $query->{$isInverse ? 'whereDoesntHave' : 'whereHas'}(
        'subscriptions.user',
        fn (Builder $query) => $query->whereKey(auth()->user()),
    )),
```

In this example, the operator is able to filter records based on whether or not the authenticated user is subscribed to the record. A subscription is recorded in the `subscriptions` relationship of the table.

The `baseQuery()` method is used to define the query that will be used to filter the records. The `$isInverse` argument is `false` when the "Subscribed" option is selected, and `true` when the "Not subscribed" option is selected. The function is applied to the base query of the table, where `whereHas()` can be used. If your function does not need to be applied to the base query of the table, like when you are using a simple `where()` or `whereIn()`, you can use the `query()` method instead, which has the bonus of being able to be used inside nested "OR" groups.

The `label()` method is used to render the options in the operator select. Two options are registered for each operator, one for when the operator is not inverted, and one for when it is inverted.

The `summary()` method is used in the header of the constraint when it is applied to the query, to provide an overview of the active constraint.

## Customizing the constraint picker

### Changing the number of columns in the constraint picker

The constraint picker has only 1 column. You may customize it by passing a number of columns to `constraintPickerColumns()`:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder;

QueryBuilder::make()
    ->constraintPickerColumns(2)
    ->constraints([
        // ...
    ])
```

This method can be used in a couple of different ways:

- You can pass an integer like `constraintPickerColumns(2)`. This integer is the number of columns used on the `lg` breakpoint and higher. All smaller devices will have just 1 column.
- You can pass an array, where the key is the breakpoint and the value is the number of columns. For example, `constraintPickerColumns(['md' => 2, 'xl' => 4])` will create a 2 column layout on medium devices, and a 4 column layout on extra large devices. The default breakpoint for smaller devices uses 1 column, unless you use a `default` array key.

Breakpoints (`sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, `2xl`) are defined by Tailwind, and can be found in the [Tailwind documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design#overview).

### Increasing the width of the constraint picker

When you [increase the number of columns](#changing-the-number-of-columns-in-the-constraint-picker), the width of the dropdown should increase incrementally to handle the additional columns. If you'd like more control, you can manually set a maximum width for the dropdown using the `constraintPickerWidth()` method. Options correspond to [Tailwind's max-width scale](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/max-width). The options are `xs`, `sm`, `md`, `lg`, `xl`, `2xl`, `3xl`, `4xl`, `5xl`, `6xl`, `7xl`:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\QueryBuilder;

QueryBuilder::make()
    ->constraintPickerColumns(3)
    ->constraintPickerWidth('2xl')
    ->constraints([
        // ...
    ])
```

## Custom filter forms

<LaracastsBanner
    title="Build a Custom Table Filter"
    description="Watch the Build Advanced Components for Filament series on Laracasts - it will teach you how to build components, and you'll get to know all the internal tools to help you."
    url="https://laracasts.com/series/build-advanced-components-for-filament/episodes/11"
    series="building-advanced-components"
/>

You may use components from the [Form Builder](../../forms/fields/getting-started) to create custom filter forms. The data from the custom filter form is available in the `$data` array of the `query()` callback:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\DatePicker;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\Filter;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

Filter::make('created_at')
    ->form([
        DatePicker::make('created_from'),
        DatePicker::make('created_until'),
    ])
    ->query(function (Builder $query, array $data): Builder {
        return $query
            ->when(
                $data['created_from'],
                fn (Builder $query, $date): Builder => $query->whereDate('created_at', '>=', $date),
            )
            ->when(
                $data['created_until'],
                fn (Builder $query, $date): Builder => $query->whereDate('created_at', '<=', $date),
            );
    })
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/filters/custom-form" alt="Table with custom filter form" version="3.x" />

### Setting default values for custom filter fields

To customize the default value of a field in a custom filter form, you may use the `default()` method:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\DatePicker;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\Filter;

Filter::make('created_at')
    ->form([
        DatePicker::make('created_from'),
        DatePicker::make('created_until')
            ->default(now()),
    ])
```

## Active indicators

When a filter is active, an indicator is displayed above the table content to signal that the table query has been scoped.

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/filters/indicators" alt="Table with filter indicators" version="3.x" />

By default, the label of the filter is used as the indicator. You can override this using the `indicator()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Filters\Filter;

Filter::make('is_admin')
    ->label('Administrators only?')
    ->indicator('Administrators')
```

If you are using a [custom filter form](#custom-filter-forms), you should use [`indicateUsing()`](#custom-active-indicators) to display an active indicator.

Please note: if you do not have an indicator for your filter, then the badge-count of how many filters are active in the table will not include that filter.

### Custom active indicators

Not all indicators are simple, so you may need to use `indicateUsing()` to customize which indicators should be shown at any time.

For example, if you have a custom date filter, you may create a custom indicator that formats the selected date:

```php
use Carbon\Carbon;
use Filament\Forms\Components\DatePicker;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\Filter;

Filter::make('created_at')
    ->form([DatePicker::make('date')])
    // ...
    ->indicateUsing(function (array $data): ?string {
        if (! $data['date']) {
            return null;
        }

        return 'Created at ' . Carbon::parse($data['date'])->toFormattedDateString();
    })
```

### Multiple active indicators

You may even render multiple indicators at once, by returning an array of `Indicator` objects. If you have different fields associated with different indicators, you should set the field using the `removeField()` method on the `Indicator` object to ensure that the correct field is reset when the filter is removed:

```php
use Carbon\Carbon;
use Filament\Forms\Components\DatePicker;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\Filter;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\Indicator;

Filter::make('created_at')
    ->form([
        DatePicker::make('from'),
        DatePicker::make('until'),
    ])
    // ...
    ->indicateUsing(function (array $data): array {
        $indicators = [];

        if ($data['from'] ?? null) {
            $indicators[] = Indicator::make('Created from ' . Carbon::parse($data['from'])->toFormattedDateString())
                ->removeField('from');
        }

        if ($data['until'] ?? null) {
            $indicators[] = Indicator::make('Created until ' . Carbon::parse($data['until'])->toFormattedDateString())
                ->removeField('until');
        }

        return $indicators;
    })
```

### Preventing indicators from being removed

You can prevent users from removing an indicator using `removable(false)` on an `Indicator` object:

```php
use Carbon\Carbon;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\Indicator;

Indicator::make('Created from ' . Carbon::parse($data['from'])->toFormattedDateString())
    ->removable(false)
```

import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"

## Positioning filters into grid columns

To change the number of columns that filters may occupy, you may use the `filtersFormColumns()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->filters([
            // ...
        ])
        ->filtersFormColumns(3);
}
```

## Controlling the width of the filters dropdown

To customize the dropdown width, you may use the `filtersFormWidth()` method, and specify a width - `ExtraSmall`, `Small`, `Medium`, `Large`, `ExtraLarge`, `TwoExtraLarge`, `ThreeExtraLarge`, `FourExtraLarge`, `FiveExtraLarge`, `SixExtraLarge` or `SevenExtraLarge`. By default, the width is `ExtraSmall`:

```php
use Filament\Support\Enums\MaxWidth;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->filters([
            // ...
        ])
        ->filtersFormWidth(MaxWidth::FourExtraLarge);
}
```

## Controlling the maximum height of the filters dropdown

To add a maximum height to the filters' dropdown content, so that they scroll, you may use the `filtersFormMaxHeight()` method, passing a [CSS length](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/length):

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->filters([
            // ...
        ])
        ->filtersFormMaxHeight('400px');
}
```

## Displaying filters in a modal

To render the filters in a modal instead of in a dropdown, you may use:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Enums\FiltersLayout;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->filters([
            // ...
        ], layout: FiltersLayout::Modal);
}
```

You may use the [trigger action API](getting-started#customizing-the-filters-trigger-action) to [customize the modal](../actions/modals), including [using a `slideOver()`](../actions/modals#using-a-slide-over-instead-of-a-modal).

## Displaying filters above the table content

To render the filters above the table content instead of in a dropdown, you may use:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Enums\FiltersLayout;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->filters([
            // ...
        ], layout: FiltersLayout::AboveContent);
}
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/filters/above-content" alt="Table with filters above content" version="3.x" />

### Allowing filters above the table content to be collapsed

To allow the filters above the table content to be collapsed, you may use:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Enums\FiltersLayout;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->filters([
            // ...
        ], layout: FiltersLayout::AboveContentCollapsible);
}
```

## Displaying filters below the table content

To render the filters below the table content instead of in a dropdown, you may use:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Enums\FiltersLayout;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->filters([
            // ...
        ], layout: FiltersLayout::BelowContent);
}
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/filters/below-content" alt="Table with filters below content" version="3.x" />

## Hiding the filter indicators

To hide the active filters indicators above the table, you may use `hiddenFilterIndicators()`:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->filters([
            // ...
        ])
        ->hiddenFilterIndicators();
}
```

## Customizing the filter form schema

You may customize the [form schema](../../forms/layout) of the entire filter form at once, in order to rearrange filters into your desired layout, and use any of the [layout components](../../forms/layout) available to forms. To do this, use the `filterFormSchema()` method, passing a closure function that receives the array of defined `$filters` that you can insert:

```php
use Filament\Forms\Components\Section;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\Filter;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->filters([
            Filter::make('is_featured'),
            Filter::make('published_at'),
            Filter::make('author'),
        ])
        ->filtersFormColumns(2)
        ->filtersFormSchema(fn (array $filters): array => [
            Section::make('Visibility')
                ->description('These filters affect the visibility of the records in the table.')
                ->schema([
                    $filters['is_featured'],
                    $filters['published_at'],
                ])
                    ->columns(2)
                ->columnSpanFull(),
            $filters['author'],
        ]);
}
```

In this example, we have put two of the filters inside a [section](../../forms/layout/section) component, and used the `columns()` method to specify that the section should have two columns. We have also used the `columnSpanFull()` method to specify that the section should span the full width of the filter form, which is also 2 columns wide. We have inserted each filter into the form schema by using the filter's name as the key in the `$filters` array.

## Overview

<LaracastsBanner
    title="Table Actions"
    description="Watch the Rapid Laravel Development with Filament series on Laracasts - it will teach you the basics of adding actions to Filament resource tables."
    url="https://laracasts.com/series/rapid-laravel-development-with-filament/episodes/11"
    series="rapid-laravel-development"
/>

Filament's tables can use [Actions](../actions). They are buttons that can be added to the [end of any table row](#row-actions), or even in the [header](#header-actions) of a table. For instance, you may want an action to "create" a new record in the header, and then "edit" and "delete" actions on each row. [Bulk actions](#bulk-actions) can be used to execute code when records in the table are selected. Additionally, actions can be added to any [table column](#column-actions), such that each cell in that column is a trigger for your action.

It's highly advised that you read the documentation about [customizing action trigger buttons](../actions/trigger-button) and [action modals](../actions/modals) to that you are aware of the full capabilities of actions.

## Row actions

Action buttons can be rendered at the end of each table row. You can put them in the `$table->actions()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->actions([
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

Actions may be created using the static `make()` method, passing its unique name.

You can then pass a function to `action()` which executes the task, or a function to `url()` which creates a link:

```php
use App\Models\Post;
use Filament\Tables\Actions\Action;

Action::make('edit')
    ->url(fn (Post $record): string => route('posts.edit', $record))
    ->openUrlInNewTab()

Action::make('delete')
    ->requiresConfirmation()
    ->action(fn (Post $record) => $record->delete())
```

All methods on the action accept callback functions, where you can access the current table `$record` that was clicked.

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/actions/simple" alt="Table with actions" version="3.x" />

### Positioning row actions before columns

By default, the row actions in your table are rendered in the final cell of each row. You may move them before the columns by using the `position` argument:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Enums\ActionsPosition;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->actions([
            // ...
        ], position: ActionsPosition::BeforeColumns);
}
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/actions/before-columns" alt="Table with actions before columns" version="3.x" />

### Positioning row actions before the checkbox column

By default, the row actions in your table are rendered in the final cell of each row. You may move them before the checkbox column by using the `position` argument:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Enums\ActionsPosition;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->actions([
            // ...
        ], position: ActionsPosition::BeforeCells);
}
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/actions/before-cells" alt="Table with actions before cells" version="3.x" />

### Accessing the selected table rows

You may want an action to be able to access all the selected rows in the table. Usually, this is done with a [bulk action](#bulk-actions) in the header of the table. However, you may want to do this with a row action, where the selected rows provide context for the action.

For example, you may want to have a row action that copies the row data to all the selected records. To force the table to be selectable, even if there aren't bulk actions defined, you need to use the `selectable()` method. To allow the action to access the selected records, you need to use the `accessSelectedRecords()` method. Then, you can use the `$selectedRecords` parameter in your action to access the selected records:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;
use Filament\Tables\Actions\Action;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Collection;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->selectable()
        ->actions([
            Action::make('copyToSelected')
                ->accessSelectedRecords()
                ->action(function (Model $record, Collection $selectedRecords) {
                    $selectedRecords->each(
                        fn (Model $selectedRecord) => $selectedRecord->update([
                            'is_active' => $record->is_active,
                        ]),
                    );
                }),
        ]);
}
```

## Bulk actions

Tables also support "bulk actions". These can be used when the user selects rows in the table. Traditionally, when rows are selected, a "bulk actions" button appears in the top left corner of the table. When the user clicks this button, they are presented with a dropdown menu of actions to choose from. You can put them in the `$table->bulkActions()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->bulkActions([
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

Bulk actions may be created using the static `make()` method, passing its unique name. You should then pass a callback to `action()` which executes the task:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Actions\BulkAction;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Collection;

BulkAction::make('delete')
    ->requiresConfirmation()
    ->action(fn (Collection $records) => $records->each->delete())
```

The function allows you to access the current table `$records` that are selected. It is an Eloquent collection of models.

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/actions/bulk" alt="Table with bulk action" version="3.x" />

### Grouping bulk actions

You may use a `BulkActionGroup` object to [group multiple bulk actions together](../actions/grouping-actions) in a dropdown. Any bulk actions that remain outside the `BulkActionGroup` will be rendered next to the dropdown's trigger button:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Actions\BulkAction;
use Filament\Tables\Actions\BulkActionGroup;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->bulkActions([
            BulkActionGroup::make([
                BulkAction::make('delete')
                    ->requiresConfirmation()
                    ->action(fn (Collection $records) => $records->each->delete()),
                BulkAction::make('forceDelete')
                    ->requiresConfirmation()
                    ->action(fn (Collection $records) => $records->each->forceDelete()),
            ]),
            BulkAction::make('export')->button()->action(fn (Collection $records) => ...),
        ]);
}
```

Alternatively, if all of your bulk actions are grouped, you can use the shorthand `groupedBulkActions()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Actions\BulkAction;
use Filament\Tables\Actions\BulkActionGroup;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->groupedBulkActions([
            BulkAction::make('delete')
                ->requiresConfirmation()
                ->action(fn (Collection $records) => $records->each->delete()),
            BulkAction::make('forceDelete')
                ->requiresConfirmation()
                ->action(fn (Collection $records) => $records->each->forceDelete()),
        ]);
}
```

### Deselecting records once a bulk action has finished

You may deselect the records after a bulk action has been executed using the `deselectRecordsAfterCompletion()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Actions\BulkAction;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Collection;

BulkAction::make('delete')
    ->action(fn (Collection $records) => $records->each->delete())
    ->deselectRecordsAfterCompletion()
```

### Disabling bulk actions for some rows

You may conditionally disable bulk actions for a specific record:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->bulkActions([
            // ...
        ])
        ->checkIfRecordIsSelectableUsing(
            fn (Model $record): bool => $record->status === Status::Enabled,
        );
}
```

### Preventing bulk-selection of all pages

The `selectCurrentPageOnly()` method can be used to prevent the user from easily bulk-selecting all records in the table at once, and instead only allows them to select one page at a time:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->bulkActions([
            // ...
        ])
        ->selectCurrentPageOnly();
}
```

## Header actions

Both [row actions](#row-actions) and [bulk actions](#bulk-actions) can be rendered in the header of the table. You can put them in the `$table->headerActions()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->headerActions([
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

This is useful for things like "create" actions, which are not related to any specific table row, or bulk actions that need to be more visible.

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/actions/header" alt="Table with header actions" version="3.x" />

## Column actions

Actions can be added to columns, such that when a cell in that column is clicked, it acts as the trigger for an action. You can learn more about [column actions](columns/getting-started#running-actions) in the documentation.

## Prebuilt table actions

Filament includes several prebuilt actions and bulk actions that you can add to a table. Their aim is to simplify the most common Eloquent-related actions:

- [Create](../actions/prebuilt-actions/create)
- [Edit](../actions/prebuilt-actions/edit)
- [View](../actions/prebuilt-actions/view)
- [Delete](../actions/prebuilt-actions/delete)
- [Replicate](../actions/prebuilt-actions/replicate)
- [Force-delete](../actions/prebuilt-actions/force-delete)
- [Restore](../actions/prebuilt-actions/restore)
- [Import](../actions/prebuilt-actions/import)
- [Export](../actions/prebuilt-actions/export)

## Grouping actions

You may use an `ActionGroup` object to group multiple table actions together in a dropdown:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Actions\ActionGroup;
use Filament\Tables\Actions\DeleteAction;
use Filament\Tables\Actions\EditAction;
use Filament\Tables\Actions\ViewAction;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->actions([
            ActionGroup::make([
                ViewAction::make(),
                EditAction::make(),
                DeleteAction::make(),
            ]),
            // ...
        ]);
}
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/actions/group" alt="Table with action group" version="3.x" />

### Choosing an action group button style

Out of the box, action group triggers have 3 styles - "button", "link", and "icon button".

"Icon button" triggers are circular buttons with an [icon](#setting-the-action-group-button-icon) and no label. Usually, this is the default button style, but you can use it manually with the `iconButton()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Actions\ActionGroup;

ActionGroup::make([
    // ...
])->iconButton()
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/actions/group-icon-button" alt="Table with icon button action group" version="3.x" />

"Button" triggers have a background color, label, and optionally an [icon](#setting-the-action-group-button-icon). You can switch to that style with the `button()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Actions\ActionGroup;

ActionGroup::make([
    // ...
])
    ->button()
    ->label('Actions')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/actions/group-button" alt="Table with button action group" version="3.x" />

"Link" triggers have no background color. They must have a label and optionally an [icon](#setting-the-action-group-button-icon). They look like a link that you might find embedded within text. You can switch to that style with the `link()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Actions\ActionGroup;

ActionGroup::make([
    // ...
])
    ->link()
    ->label('Actions')
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/actions/group-link" alt="Table with link action group" version="3.x" />

### Setting the action group button icon

You may set the [icon](https://blade-ui-kit.com/blade-icons?set=1#search) of the action group button using the `icon()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Actions\ActionGroup;

ActionGroup::make([
    // ...
])->icon('heroicon-m-ellipsis-horizontal');
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/actions/group-icon" alt="Table with customized action group icon" version="3.x" />

### Setting the action group button color

You may set the color of the action group button using the `color()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Actions\ActionGroup;

ActionGroup::make([
    // ...
])->color('info');
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/actions/group-color" alt="Table with customized action group color" version="3.x" />

### Setting the action group button size

Buttons come in 3 sizes - `sm`, `md` or `lg`. You may set the size of the action group button using the `size()` method:

```php
use Filament\Support\Enums\ActionSize;
use Filament\Tables\Actions\ActionGroup;

ActionGroup::make([
    // ...
])->size(ActionSize::Small);
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/actions/group-small" alt="Table with small action group" version="3.x" />

### Setting the action group tooltip

You may set the tooltip of the action group using the `tooltip()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Actions\ActionGroup;

ActionGroup::make([
    // ...
])->tooltip('Actions');
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/actions/group-tooltip" alt="Table with action group tooltip" version="3.x" />

## Table action utility injection

All actions, not just table actions, have access to [many utilities](../actions/advanced#action-utility-injection) within the vast majority of configuration methods. However, in addition to those, table actions have access to a few more:

### Injecting the current Eloquent record

If you wish to access the current Eloquent record of the action, define a `$record` parameter:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

function (Model $record) {
    // ...
}
```

Be aware that bulk actions, header actions, and empty state actions do not have access to the `$record`, as they are not related to any table row.

### Injecting the current Eloquent model class

If you wish to access the current Eloquent model class of the table, define a `$model` parameter:

```php
function (string $model) {
    // ...
}
```

### Injecting the current table instance

If you wish to access the current table configuration instance that the action belongs to, define a `$table` parameter:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

function (Table $table) {
    // ...
}
```

## The problem with traditional table layouts

Traditional tables are notorious for having bad responsiveness. On mobile, there is only so much flexibility you have when rendering content that is horizontally long:

- Allow the user to scroll horizontally to see more table content
- Hide non-important columns on smaller devices

Both of these are possible with Filament. Tables automatically scroll horizontally when they overflow anyway, and you may choose to show and hide columns based on the responsive [breakpoint](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design#overview) of the browser. To do this, you may use a `visibleFrom()` or `hiddenFrom()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('slug')
    ->visibleFrom('md')
```

This is fine, but there is still a glaring issue - **on mobile, the user is unable to see much information in a table row at once without scrolling**.

Thankfully, Filament lets you build responsive table-like interfaces, without touching HTML or CSS. These layouts let you define exactly where content appears in a table row, at each responsive breakpoint.

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/layout/demo" alt="Table with responsive layout" version="3.x" />

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/layout/demo/mobile" alt="Table with responsive layout on mobile" version="3.x" />

## Allowing columns to stack on mobile

Let's introduce a component - `Split`:

```php
use Filament\Support\Enums\FontWeight;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Layout\Split;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

Split::make([
    ImageColumn::make('avatar')
        ->circular(),
    TextColumn::make('name')
        ->weight(FontWeight::Bold)
        ->searchable()
        ->sortable(),
    TextColumn::make('email'),
])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/layout/split" alt="Table with a split layout" version="3.x" />

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/layout/split/mobile" alt="Table with a split layout on mobile" version="3.x" />

A `Split` component is used to wrap around columns, and allow them to stack on mobile.

By default, columns within a split will appear aside each other all the time. However, you may choose a responsive [breakpoint](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design#overview) where this behavior starts `from()`. Before this point, the columns will stack on top of each other:

```php
use Filament\Support\Enums\FontWeight;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Layout\Split;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ImageColumn;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

Split::make([
    ImageColumn::make('avatar')
        ->circular(),
    TextColumn::make('name')
        ->weight(FontWeight::Bold)
        ->searchable()
        ->sortable(),
    TextColumn::make('email'),
])->from('md')
```

In this example, the columns will only appear horizontally aside each other from `md` [breakpoint](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design#overview) devices onwards:

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/layout/split-desktop" alt="Table with a split layout on desktop" version="3.x" />

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/layout/split-desktop/mobile" alt="Table with a stacked layout on mobile" version="3.x" />

### Preventing a column from creating whitespace

Splits, like table columns, will automatically adjust their whitespace to ensure that each column has proportionate separation. You can prevent this from happening, using `grow(false)`. In this example, we will make sure that the avatar image will sit tightly against the name column:

```php
use Filament\Support\Enums\FontWeight;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Layout\Split;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ImageColumn;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

Split::make([
    ImageColumn::make('avatar')
        ->circular()
        ->grow(false),
    TextColumn::make('name')
        ->weight(FontWeight::Bold)
        ->searchable()
        ->sortable(),
    TextColumn::make('email'),
])
```

The other columns which are allowed to `grow()` will adjust to consume the newly-freed space:

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/layout/grow-disabled" alt="Table with a column that doesn't grow" version="3.x" />

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/layout/grow-disabled/mobile" alt="Table with a column that doesn't grow on mobile" version="3.x" />

### Stacking within a split

Inside a split, you may stack multiple columns on top of each other vertically. This allows you to display more data inside fewer columns on desktop:

```php
use Filament\Support\Enums\FontWeight;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Layout\Split;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Layout\Stack;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ImageColumn;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

Split::make([
    ImageColumn::make('avatar')
        ->circular(),
    TextColumn::make('name')
        ->weight(FontWeight::Bold)
        ->searchable()
        ->sortable(),
    Stack::make([
        TextColumn::make('phone')
            ->icon('heroicon-m-phone'),
        TextColumn::make('email')
            ->icon('heroicon-m-envelope'),
    ]),
])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/layout/stack" alt="Table with a stack" version="3.x" />

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/layout/stack/mobile" alt="Table with a stack on mobile" version="3.x" />

#### Hiding a stack on mobile

Similar to individual columns, you may choose to hide a stack based on the responsive [breakpoint](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design#overview) of the browser. To do this, you may use a `visibleFrom()` method:

```php
use Filament\Support\Enums\FontWeight;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Layout\Split;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Layout\Stack;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ImageColumn;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

Split::make([
    ImageColumn::make('avatar')
        ->circular(),
    TextColumn::make('name')
        ->weight(FontWeight::Bold)
        ->searchable()
        ->sortable(),
    Stack::make([
        TextColumn::make('phone')
            ->icon('heroicon-m-phone'),
        TextColumn::make('email')
            ->icon('heroicon-m-envelope'),
    ])->visibleFrom('md'),
])
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/layout/stack-hidden-on-mobile" alt="Table with a stack" version="3.x" />

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/layout/stack-hidden-on-mobile/mobile" alt="Table with no stack on mobile" version="3.x" />

#### Aligning stacked content

By default, columns within a stack are aligned to the start. You may choose to align columns within a stack to the `Alignment::Center` or `Alignment::End`:

```php
use Filament\Support\Enums\Alignment;
use Filament\Support\Enums\FontWeight;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Layout\Split;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Layout\Stack;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ImageColumn;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

Split::make([
    ImageColumn::make('avatar')
        ->circular(),
    TextColumn::make('name')
        ->weight(FontWeight::Bold)
        ->searchable()
        ->sortable(),
    Stack::make([
        TextColumn::make('phone')
            ->icon('heroicon-m-phone')
            ->grow(false),
        TextColumn::make('email')
            ->icon('heroicon-m-envelope')
            ->grow(false),
    ])
        ->alignment(Alignment::End)
        ->visibleFrom('md'),
])
```

Ensure that the columns within the stack have `grow(false)` set, otherwise they will stretch to fill the entire width of the stack and follow their own alignment configuration instead of the stack's.

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/layout/stack-aligned-right" alt="Table with a stack aligned right" version="3.x" />

#### Spacing stacked content

By default, stacked content has no vertical padding between columns. To add some, you may use the `space()` method, which accepts either `1`, `2`, or `3`, corresponding to [Tailwind's spacing scale](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/space):

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Layout\Stack;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

Stack::make([
    TextColumn::make('phone')
        ->icon('heroicon-m-phone'),
    TextColumn::make('email')
        ->icon('heroicon-m-envelope'),
])->space(1)
```

## Controlling column width using a grid

Sometimes, using a `Split` creates inconsistent widths when columns contain lots of content. This is because it's powered by Flexbox internally and each row individually controls how much space is allocated to content.

Instead, you may use a `Grid` layout, which uses CSS Grid Layout to allow you to control column widths:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Layout\Grid;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

Grid::make([
    'lg' => 2,
])
    ->schema([
        TextColumn::make('phone')
            ->icon('heroicon-m-phone'),
        TextColumn::make('email')
            ->icon('heroicon-m-envelope'),
    ])
```

These columns will always consume equal width within the grid, from the `lg` [breakpoint](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design#overview).

You may choose to customize the number of columns within the grid at other breakpoints:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Layout\Grid;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Layout\Stack;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

Grid::make([
    'lg' => 2,
    '2xl' => 4,
])
    ->schema([
        Stack::make([
            TextColumn::make('name'),
            TextColumn::make('job'),
        ]),
        TextColumn::make('phone')
            ->icon('heroicon-m-phone'),
        TextColumn::make('email')
            ->icon('heroicon-m-envelope'),
    ])
```

And you can even control how many grid columns will be consumed by each component at each [breakpoint](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design#overview):

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Layout\Grid;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Layout\Stack;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

Grid::make([
    'lg' => 2,
    '2xl' => 5,
])
    ->schema([
        Stack::make([
            TextColumn::make('name'),
            TextColumn::make('job'),
        ])->columnSpan([
            'lg' => 'full',
            '2xl' => 2,
        ]),
        TextColumn::make('phone')
            ->icon('heroicon-m-phone')
            ->columnSpan([
                '2xl' => 2,
            ]),
        TextColumn::make('email')
            ->icon('heroicon-m-envelope'),
    ])
```

## Collapsible content

When you're using a column layout like split or stack, then you can also add collapsible content. This is very useful for when you don't want to display all data in the table at once, but still want it to be accessible to the user if they need to access it, without navigating away.

Split and stack components can be made `collapsible()`, but there is also a dedicated `Panel` component that provides a pre-styled background color and border radius, to separate the collapsible content from the rest:

```php
use Filament\Support\Enums\FontWeight;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Layout\Panel;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Layout\Split;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Layout\Stack;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ImageColumn;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

[
    Split::make([
        ImageColumn::make('avatar')
            ->circular(),
        TextColumn::make('name')
            ->weight(FontWeight::Bold)
            ->searchable()
            ->sortable(),
    ]),
    Panel::make([
        Stack::make([
            TextColumn::make('phone')
                ->icon('heroicon-m-phone'),
            TextColumn::make('email')
                ->icon('heroicon-m-envelope'),
        ]),
    ])->collapsible(),
]
```

You can expand a panel by default using the `collapsed(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Layout\Panel;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Layout\Split;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

Panel::make([
    Split::make([
        TextColumn::make('phone')
            ->icon('heroicon-m-phone'),
        TextColumn::make('email')
            ->icon('heroicon-m-envelope'),
    ])->from('md'),
])->collapsed(false)
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/layout/collapsible" alt="Table with collapsible content" version="3.x" />

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/layout/collapsible/mobile" alt="Table with collapsible content on mobile" version="3.x" />

## Arranging records into a grid

Sometimes, you may find that your data fits into a grid format better than a list. Filament can handle that too!

Simply use the `$table->contentGrid()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Layout\Stack;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            Stack::make([
                // Columns
            ]),
        ])
        ->contentGrid([
            'md' => 2,
            'xl' => 3,
        ]);
}
```

In this example, the rows will be displayed in a grid:

- On mobile, they will be displayed in 1 column only.
- From the `md` [breakpoint](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design#overview), they will be displayed in 2 columns.
- From the `xl` [breakpoint](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design#overview) onwards, they will be displayed in 3 columns.

These settings are fully customizable, any [breakpoint](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design#overview) from `sm` to `2xl` can contain `1` to `12` columns.

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/layout/grid" alt="Table with grid layout" version="3.x" />

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/layout/grid/mobile" alt="Table with grid layout on mobile" version="3.x" />

## Custom HTML

You may add custom HTML to your table using a `View` component. It can even be `collapsible()`:

```php
use Filament\Support\Enums\FontWeight;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Layout\Split;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Layout\View;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ImageColumn;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

[
    Split::make([
        ImageColumn::make('avatar')
            ->circular(),
        TextColumn::make('name')
            ->weight(FontWeight::Bold)
            ->searchable()
            ->sortable(),
    ]),
    View::make('users.table.collapsible-row-content')
        ->collapsible(),
]
```

Now, create a `/resources/views/users/table/collapsible-row-content.blade.php` file, and add in your HTML. You can access the table record using `$getRecord()`:

```blade
<p class="px-4 py-3 bg-gray-100 rounded-lg">
    <span class="font-medium">
        Email address:
    </span>

    <span>
        {{ $getRecord()->email }}
    </span>
</p>
```

### Embedding other components

You could even pass in columns or other layout components to the `components()` method:

```php
use Filament\Support\Enums\FontWeight;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Layout\Split;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Layout\View;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\ImageColumn;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

[
    Split::make([
        ImageColumn::make('avatar')
            ->circular(),
        TextColumn::make('name')
            ->weight(FontWeight::Bold)
            ->searchable()
            ->sortable(),
    ]),
    View::make('users.table.collapsible-row-content')
        ->components([
            TextColumn::make('email')
                ->icon('heroicon-m-envelope'),
        ])
        ->collapsible(),
]
```

Now, render the components in the Blade file:

```blade
<div class="px-4 py-3 bg-gray-100 rounded-lg">
    <x-filament-tables::columns.layout
        :components="$getComponents()"
        :record="$getRecord()"
        :record-key="$recordKey"
    />
</div>
```

# Documentation for tables. File: 07-summaries.md
---
title: Summaries
---
import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"

## Overview

You may render a "summary" section below your table content. This is great for displaying the results of calculations such as averages, sums, counts, and ranges of the data in your table.

By default, there will be a single summary line for the current page of data, and an additional summary line for the totals for all data if multiple pages are available. You may also add summaries for [groups](grouping) of records, see ["Summarising groups of rows"](#summarising-groups-of-rows).

"Summarizer" objects can be added to any [table column](columns) using the `summarize()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Summarizers\Average;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('rating')
    ->summarize(Average::make())
```

Multiple "summarizers" may be added to the same column:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Summarizers\Average;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Summarizers\Range;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('rating')
    ->numeric()
    ->summarize([
        Average::make(),
        Range::make(),
    ])
```

> The first column in a table may not use summarizers. That column is used to render the heading and subheading/s of the summary section.

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/summaries" alt="Table with summaries" version="3.x" />

## Available summarizers

Filament ships with four types of summarizer:

- [Average](#average)
- [Count](#count)
- [Range](#range)
- [Sum](#sum)

You may also [create your own custom summarizers](#custom-summaries) to display data in whatever way you wish.

## Average

Average can be used to calculate the average of all values in the dataset:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Summarizers\Average;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('rating')
    ->summarize(Average::make())
```

In this example, all ratings in the table will be added together and divided by the number of ratings.

## Count

Count can be used to find the total number of values in the dataset. Unless you just want to calculate the number of rows, you will probably want to [scope the dataset](#scoping-the-dataset) as well:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\IconColumn;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Summarizers\Count;
use Illuminate\Database\Query\Builder;

IconColumn::make('is_published')
    ->boolean()
    ->summarize(
        Count::make()->query(fn (Builder $query) => $query->where('is_published', true)),
    ),
```

In this example, the table will calculate how many posts are published.

### Counting the occurrence of icons

Using a count on an [icon column](columns/icon) allows you to use the `icons()` method, which gives the user a visual representation of how many of each icon are in the table:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\IconColumn;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Summarizers\Count;
use Illuminate\Database\Query\Builder;

IconColumn::make('is_published')
    ->boolean()
    ->summarize(Count::make()->icons()),
```

## Range

Range can be used to calculate the minimum and maximum value in the dataset:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Summarizers\Range;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('price')
    ->summarize(Range::make())
```

In this example, the minimum and maximum price in the table will be found.

### Date range

You may format the range as dates using the `minimalDateTimeDifference()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Summarizers\Range;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('created_at')
    ->dateTime()
    ->summarize(Range::make()->minimalDateTimeDifference())
```

This method will present the minimal difference between the minimum and maximum date. For example:

- If the minimum and maximum dates are different days, only the dates will be displayed.
- If the minimum and maximum dates are on the same day at different times, both the date and time will be displayed.
- If the minimum and maximum dates and times are identical, they will only appear once.

### Text range

You may format the range as text using the `minimalTextualDifference()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Summarizers\Range;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('sku')
    ->summarize(Range::make()->minimalTextualDifference())
```

This method will present the minimal difference between the minimum and maximum. For example:

- If the minimum and maximum start with different letters, only the first letters will be displayed.
- If the minimum and maximum start with the same letter, more of the text will be rendered until a difference is found.
- If the minimum and maximum are identical, they will only appear once.

### Including null values in the range

By default, we will exclude null values from the range. If you would like to include them, you may use the `excludeNull(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Summarizers\Range;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('sku')
    ->summarize(Range::make()->excludeNull(false))
```

## Sum

Sum can be used to calculate the total of all values in the dataset:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Summarizers\Sum;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('price')
    ->summarize(Sum::make())
```

In this example, all prices in the table will be added together.

## Setting a label

You may set a summarizer's label using the `label()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Summarizers\Sum;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('price')
    ->summarize(Sum::make()->label('Total'))
```

## Scoping the dataset

You may apply a database query scope to a summarizer's dataset using the `query()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Summarizers\Average;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;
use Illuminate\Database\Query\Builder;

TextColumn::make('rating')
    ->summarize(
        Average::make()->query(fn (Builder $query) => $query->where('is_published', true)),
    ),
```

In this example, now only rows where `is_published` is set to `true` will be used to calculate the average.

This feature is especially useful with the [count](#count) summarizer, as it can count how many records in the dataset pass a test:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\IconColumn;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Summarizers\Count;
use Illuminate\Database\Query\Builder;

IconColumn::make('is_published')
    ->boolean()
    ->summarize(
        Count::make()->query(fn (Builder $query) => $query->where('is_published', true)),
    ),
```

In this example, the table will calculate how many posts are published.

## Formatting

### Number formatting

The `numeric()` method allows you to format an entry as a number:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Summarizers\Average;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('rating')
    ->summarize(Average::make()->numeric())
```

If you would like to customize the number of decimal places used to format the number with, you can use the `decimalPlaces` argument:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Summarizers\Average;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('rating')
    ->summarize(Average::make()->numeric(
        decimalPlaces: 0,
    ))
```

By default, your app's locale will be used to format the number suitably. If you would like to customize the locale used, you can pass it to the `locale` argument:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Summarizers\Average;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('rating')
    ->summarize(Average::make()->numeric(
        locale: 'nl',
    ))
```

Alternatively, you can set the default locale used across your app using the `Table::$defaultNumberLocale` method in the `boot()` method of a service provider:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

Table::$defaultNumberLocale = 'nl';
```

### Currency formatting

The `money()` method allows you to easily format monetary values, in any currency:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Summarizers\Sum;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('price')
    ->summarize(Sum::make()->money('EUR'))
```

There is also a `divideBy` argument for `money()` that allows you to divide the original value by a number before formatting it. This could be useful if your database stores the price in cents, for example:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Summarizers\Sum;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('price')
    ->summarize(Sum::make()->money('EUR', divideBy: 100))
```

By default, your app's locale will be used to format the money suitably. If you would like to customize the locale used, you can pass it to the `locale` argument:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Summarizers\Average;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('price')
    ->summarize(Sum::make()->money('EUR', locale: 'nl'))
```

Alternatively, you can set the default locale used across your app using the `Table::$defaultNumberLocale` method in the `boot()` method of a service provider:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

Table::$defaultNumberLocale = 'nl';
```

### Limiting text length

You may `limit()` the length of the summary's value:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Summarizers\Range;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('sku')
    ->summarize(Range::make()->limit(5))
```

### Adding a prefix or suffix

You may add a prefix or suffix to the summary's value:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Summarizers\Sum;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;
use Illuminate\Support\HtmlString;

TextColumn::make('volume')
    ->summarize(Sum::make()
        ->prefix('Total volume: ')
        ->suffix(new HtmlString(' m&sup3;'))
    )
```

## Custom summaries

You may create a custom summary by returning the value from the `using()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Summarizers\Summarizer;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;
use Illuminate\Database\Query\Builder;

TextColumn::make('name')
    ->summarize(Summarizer::make()
        ->label('First last name')
        ->using(fn (Builder $query): string => $query->min('last_name')))
```

The callback has access to the database `$query` builder instance to perform calculations with. It should return the value to display in the table.

## Conditionally hiding the summary

To hide a summary, you may pass a boolean, or a function that returns a boolean, to the `hidden()` method. If you need it, you can access the Eloquent query builder instance for that summarizer via the `$query` argument of the function:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Summarizers\Summarizer;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

TextColumn::make('sku')
    ->summarize(Summarizer::make()
        ->hidden(fn (Builder $query): bool => ! $query->exists()))
```

Alternatively, you can use the `visible()` method to achieve the opposite effect:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Summarizers\Summarizer;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

TextColumn::make('sku')
    ->summarize(Summarizer::make()
        ->visible(fn (Builder $query): bool => $query->exists()))
```

## Summarising groups of rows

You can use summaries with [groups](grouping) to display a summary of the records inside a group. This works automatically if you choose to add a summariser to a column in a grouped table.

### Hiding the grouped rows and showing the summary only

You may hide the rows inside groups and just show the summary of each group using the `groupsOnly()` method. This is beneficial in many reporting scenarios.

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Summarizers\Sum;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            TextColumn::make('views_count')
                ->summarize(Sum::make()),
            TextColumn::make('likes_count')
                ->summarize(Sum::make()),
        ])
        ->defaultGroup('category')
        ->groupsOnly();
}
```

# Documentation for tables. File: 08-grouping.md
---
title: Grouping rows
---
import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"

## Overview

You may allow users to group table rows together using a common attribute. This is useful for displaying lots of data in a more organized way.

Groups can be set up using the name of the attribute to group by (e.g. `'status'`), or a `Group` object which allows you to customize the behavior of that grouping (e.g. `Group::make('status')->collapsible()`).

## Grouping rows by default

You may want to always group posts by a specific attribute. To do this, pass the group to the `defaultGroup()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->defaultGroup('status');
}
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/grouping" alt="Table with grouping" version="3.x" />

## Allowing users to choose between groupings

You may also allow users to pick between different groupings, by passing them in an array to the `groups()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->groups([
            'status',
            'category',
        ]);
}
```

You can use both `groups()` and `defaultGroup()` together to allow users to choose between different groupings, but have a default grouping set:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->groups([
            'status',
            'category',
        ])
        ->defaultGroup('status');
}
```

## Grouping by a relationship attribute

You can also group by a relationship attribute using dot-syntax. For example, if you have an `author` relationship which has a `name` attribute, you can use `author.name` as the name of the attribute:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->groups([
            'author.name',
        ]);
}
```

## Setting a grouping label

By default, the label of the grouping will be generated based on the attribute. You may customize it with a `Group` object, using the `label()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Grouping\Group;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->groups([
            Group::make('author.name')
                ->label('Author name'),
        ]);
}
```

## Setting a group title

By default, the title of a group will be the value of the attribute. You may customize it by returning a new title from the `getTitleFromRecordUsing()` method of a `Group` object:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Grouping\Group;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->groups([
            Group::make('status')
                ->getTitleFromRecordUsing(fn (Post $record): string => ucfirst($record->status->getLabel())),
        ]);
}
```

### Disabling the title label prefix

By default, the title is prefixed with the label of the group. To disable this prefix, utilize the `titlePrefixedWithLabel(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Grouping\Group;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->groups([
            Group::make('status')
                ->titlePrefixedWithLabel(false),
        ]);
}
```

## Setting a group description

You may also set a description for a group, which will be displayed underneath the group title. To do this, use the `getDescriptionFromRecordUsing()` method on a `Group` object:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Grouping\Group;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->groups([
            Group::make('status')
                ->getDescriptionFromRecordUsing(fn (Post $record): string => $record->status->getDescription()),
        ]);
}
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/grouping-descriptions" alt="Table with group descriptions" version="3.x" />

## Setting a group key

By default, the key of a group will be the value of the attribute. It is used internally as a raw identifier of that group, instead of the [title](#setting-a-group-title). You may customize it by returning a new key from the `getKeyFromRecordUsing()` method of a `Group` object:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Grouping\Group;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->groups([
            Group::make('status')
                ->getKeyFromRecordUsing(fn (Post $record): string => $record->status->value),
        ]);
}
```

## Date groups

When using a date-time column as a group, you may want to group by the date only, and ignore the time. To do this, use the `date()` method on a `Group` object:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Grouping\Group;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->groups([
            Group::make('created_at')
                ->date(),
        ]);
}
```

## Collapsible groups

You can allow rows inside a group to be collapsed underneath their group title. To enable this, use a `Group` object with the `collapsible()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Grouping\Group;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->groups([
            Group::make('author.name')
                ->collapsible(),
        ]);
}
```

## Summarising groups

You can use [summaries](summaries) with groups to display a summary of the records inside a group. This works automatically if you choose to add a summariser to a column in a grouped table.

### Hiding the grouped rows and showing the summary only

You may hide the rows inside groups and just show the summary of each group using the `groupsOnly()` method. This is very useful in many reporting scenarios.

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Summarizers\Sum;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->columns([
            TextColumn::make('views_count')
                ->summarize(Sum::make()),
            TextColumn::make('likes_count')
                ->summarize(Sum::make()),
        ])
        ->defaultGroup('category')
        ->groupsOnly();
}
```

## Customizing the Eloquent query ordering behavior

Some features require the table to be able to order an Eloquent query according to a group. You can customize how we do this using the `orderQueryUsing()` method on a `Group` object:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Grouping\Group;
use Filament\Tables\Table;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->groups([
            Group::make('status')
                ->orderQueryUsing(fn (Builder $query, string $direction) => $query->orderBy('status', $direction)),
        ]);
}
```

## Customizing the Eloquent query scoping behavior

Some features require the table to be able to scope an Eloquent query according to a group. You can customize how we do this using the `scopeQueryByKeyUsing()` method on a `Group` object:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Grouping\Group;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->groups([
            Group::make('status')
                ->scopeQueryByKeyUsing(fn (Builder $query, string $key) => $query->where('status', $key)),
        ]);
}
```

## Customizing the Eloquent query grouping behavior

Some features require the table to be able to group an Eloquent query according to a group. You can customize how we do this using the `groupQueryUsing()` method on a `Group` object:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Grouping\Group;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->groups([
            Group::make('status')
                ->groupQueryUsing(fn (Builder $query) => $query->groupBy('status')),
        ]);
}
```

## Customizing the groups dropdown trigger action

To customize the groups dropdown trigger button, you may use the `groupRecordsTriggerAction()` method, passing a closure that returns an action. All methods that are available to [customize action trigger buttons](../actions/trigger-button) can be used:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->groups([
            // ...
        ])
        ->groupRecordsTriggerAction(
            fn (Action $action) => $action
                ->button()
                ->label('Group records'),
        );
}
```

## Using the grouping settings dropdown on desktop

By default, the grouping settings dropdown will only be shown on mobile devices. On desktop devices, the grouping settings are in the header of the table. You can enable the dropdown on desktop devices too by using the `groupingSettingsInDropdownOnDesktop()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->groups([
            // ...
        ])
        ->groupingSettingsInDropdownOnDesktop();
}
```

## Hiding the grouping settings

You can hide the grouping settings interface using the `groupingSettingsHidden()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
		->defaultGroup('status')
        ->groupingSettingsHidden();
}
```

### Hiding the grouping direction setting only

You can hide the grouping direction select interface using the `groupingDirectionSettingHidden()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
		->defaultGroup('status')
        ->groupingDirectionSettingHidden();
}
```

# Documentation for tables. File: 09-empty-state.md
---
title: Empty state
---
import AutoScreenshot from "@components/AutoScreenshot.astro"

## Overview

The table's "empty state" is rendered when there are no rows in the table.

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/empty-state" alt="Table with empty state" version="3.x" />

## Setting the empty state heading

To customize the heading of the empty state, use the `emptyStateHeading()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->emptyStateHeading('No posts yet');
}
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/empty-state-heading" alt="Table with customized empty state heading" version="3.x" />

## Setting the empty state description

To customize the description of the empty state, use the `emptyStateDescription()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->emptyStateDescription('Once you write your first post, it will appear here.');
}
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/empty-state-description" alt="Table with empty state description" version="3.x" />

## Setting the empty state icon

To customize the [icon](https://blade-ui-kit.com/blade-icons?set=1#search) of the empty state, use the `emptyStateIcon()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->emptyStateIcon('heroicon-o-bookmark');
}
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/empty-state-icon" alt="Table with customized empty state icon" version="3.x" />

## Adding empty state actions

You can add [Actions](actions) to the empty state to prompt users to take action. Pass these to the `emptyStateActions()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->emptyStateActions([
            Action::make('create')
                ->label('Create post')
                ->url(route('posts.create'))
                ->icon('heroicon-m-plus')
                ->button(),
        ]);
}
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/empty-state-actions" alt="Table with empty state actions" version="3.x" />

## Using a custom empty state view

You may use a completely custom empty state view by passing it to the `emptyState()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->emptyState(view('tables.posts.empty-state'));
}
```

## Pagination

### Disabling pagination

By default, tables will be paginated. To disable this, you should use the `$table->paginated(false)` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->paginated(false);
}
```

### Customizing the pagination options

You may customize the options for the paginated records per page select by passing them to the `paginated()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->paginated([10, 25, 50, 100, 'all']);
}
```

### Customizing the default pagination page option

To customize the default number of records shown use the `defaultPaginationPageOption()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->defaultPaginationPageOption(25);
}
```

### Preventing query string conflicts with the pagination page

By default, Livewire stores the pagination state in a `page` parameter of the URL query string. If you have multiple tables on the same page, this will mean that the pagination state of one table may be overwritten by the state of another table.

To fix this, you may define a `$table->queryStringIdentifier()`, to return a unique query string identifier for that table:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->queryStringIdentifier('users');
}
```

### Displaying links to the first and the last pagination page

To add "extreme" links to the first and the last page using the `extremePaginationLinks()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->extremePaginationLinks();
}
```

### Using simple pagination

You may use simple pagination by overriding `paginateTableQuery()` method.

First, locate your Livewire component. If you're using a resource from the Panel Builder and you want to add simple pagination to the List page, you'll want to open the `Pages/List.php` file in the resource, not the resource class itself.

```php
use Illuminate\Contracts\Pagination\Paginator;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

protected function paginateTableQuery(Builder $query): Paginator
{
    return $query->simplePaginate(($this->getTableRecordsPerPage() === 'all') ? $query->count() : $this->getTableRecordsPerPage());
}
```

### Using cursor pagination

You may use cursor pagination by overriding `paginateTableQuery()` method.

First, locate your Livewire component. If you're using a resource from the Panel Builder and you want to add simple pagination to the List page, you'll want to open the `Pages/List.php` file in the resource, not the resource class itself.

```php
use Illuminate\Contracts\Pagination\CursorPaginator;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

protected function paginateTableQuery(Builder $query): CursorPaginator
{
    return $query->cursorPaginate(($this->getTableRecordsPerPage() === 'all') ? $query->count() : $this->getTableRecordsPerPage());
}
```

## Record URLs (clickable rows)

You may allow table rows to be completely clickable by using the `$table->recordUrl()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->recordUrl(
            fn (Model $record): string => route('posts.edit', ['record' => $record]),
        );
}
```

In this example, clicking on each post will take you to the `posts.edit` route.

You may also open the URL in a new tab:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->openRecordUrlInNewTab();
}
```

If you'd like to [override the URL](columns/getting-started#opening-urls) for a specific column, or instead [run an action](columns/getting-started#running-actions) when a column is clicked, see the [columns documentation](columns/getting-started#opening-urls).

## Reordering records

To allow the user to reorder records using drag and drop in your table, you can use the `$table->reorderable()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->reorderable('sort');
}
```

If you're using mass assignment protection on your model, you will also need to add the `sort` attribute to the `$fillable` array there.

When making the table reorderable, a new button will be available on the table to toggle reordering.

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/reordering" alt="Table with reorderable rows" version="3.x" />

The `reorderable()` method accepts the name of a column to store the record order in. If you use something like [`spatie/eloquent-sortable`](https://github.com/spatie/eloquent-sortable) with an order column such as `order_column`, you may use this instead:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->reorderable('order_column');
}
```

The `reorderable()` method also accepts a boolean condition as its second parameter, allowing you to conditionally enable reordering:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->reorderable('sort', auth()->user()->isAdmin());
}
```

### Enabling pagination while reordering

Pagination will be disabled in reorder mode to allow you to move records between pages. It is generally bad UX to re-enable pagination while reordering, but if you are sure then you can use `$table->paginatedWhileReordering()`:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->paginatedWhileReordering();
}
```

### Customizing the reordering trigger action

To customize the reordering trigger button, you may use the `reorderRecordsTriggerAction()` method, passing a closure that returns an action. All methods that are available to [customize action trigger buttons](../actions/trigger-button) can be used:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Actions\Action;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->reorderRecordsTriggerAction(
            fn (Action $action, bool $isReordering) => $action
                ->button()
                ->label($isReordering ? 'Disable reordering' : 'Enable reordering'),
        );
}
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/reordering/custom-trigger-action" alt="Table with reorderable rows and a custom trigger action" version="3.x" />

## Customizing the table header

You can add a heading to a table using the `$table->heading()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->heading('Clients')
        ->columns([
            // ...
        ]);
```

You can also add a description below the heading using the `$table->description()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->heading('Clients')
        ->description('Manage your clients here.')
        ->columns([
            // ...
        ]);
```

You can pass a view to the `$table->header()` method to customize the entire header:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->header(view('tables.header', [
            'heading' => 'Clients',
        ]))
        ->columns([
            // ...
        ]);
```

## Polling table content

You may poll table content so that it refreshes at a set interval, using the `$table->poll()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->poll('10s');
}
```

## Deferring loading

Tables with lots of data might take a while to load, in which case you can load the table data asynchronously using the `deferLoading()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->deferLoading();
}
```

## Searching records with Laravel Scout

While Filament doesn't provide a direct integration with [Laravel Scout](https://laravel.com/docs/scout), you may override methods to integrate it.

Use a `whereIn()` clause to filter the query for Scout results:

```php
use App\Models\Post;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Builder;

protected function applySearchToTableQuery(Builder $query): Builder
{
    $this->applyColumnSearchesToTableQuery($query);
    
    if (filled($search = $this->getTableSearch())) {
        $query->whereIn('id', Post::search($search)->keys());
    }

    return $query;
}
```

Scout uses this `whereIn()` method to retrieve results internally, so there is no performance penalty for using it.

The `applyColumnSearchesToTableQuery()` method ensures that searching individual columns will still work. You can replace that method with your own implementation if you want to use Scout for those search inputs as well.

For the global search input to show, at least one column in the table needs to be `searchable()`. Alternatively, if you are using Scout to control which columns are searchable already, you can simply pass `searchable()` to the entire table instead:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->searchable();
}
```

## Query string

Livewire ships with a feature to store data in the URL's query string, to access across requests.

With Filament, this allows you to store your table's filters, sort, search and pagination state in the URL.

To store the filters, sorting, and search state of your table in the query string:

```php
use Livewire\Attributes\Url;

#[Url]
public bool $isTableReordering = false;

/**
 * @var array<string, mixed> | null
 */
#[Url]
public ?array $tableFilters = null;

#[Url]
public ?string $tableGrouping = null;

#[Url]
public ?string $tableGroupingDirection = null;

/**
 * @var ?string
 */
#[Url]
public $tableSearch = '';

#[Url]
public ?string $tableSortColumn = null;

#[Url]
public ?string $tableSortDirection = null;
```

## Styling table rows

### Striped table rows

To enable striped table rows, you can use the `striped()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Table;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->striped();
}
```

<AutoScreenshot name="tables/striped" alt="Table with striped rows" version="3.x" />

### Custom row classes

You may want to conditionally style rows based on the record data. This can be achieved by specifying a string or array of CSS classes to be applied to the row using the `$table->recordClasses()` method:

```php
use Closure;
use Filament\Tables\Table;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->recordClasses(fn (Model $record) => match ($record->status) {
            'draft' => 'opacity-30',
            'reviewing' => 'border-s-2 border-orange-600 dark:border-orange-300',
            'published' => 'border-s-2 border-green-600 dark:border-green-300',
            default => null,
        });
}
```

These classes are not automatically compiled by Tailwind CSS. If you want to apply Tailwind CSS classes that are not already used in Blade files, you should update your `content` configuration in `tailwind.config.js` to also scan for classes inside your directory: `'./app/Filament/**/*.php'`

## Resetting the table

If you make changes to the table definition during a Livewire request, for example, when consuming a public property in the `table()` method, you may need to reset the table to ensure that the changes are applied. To do this, you can call the `resetTable()` method on the Livewire component:

```php
$this->resetTable();
```

## Global settings

To customize the default configuration that is used for all tables, you can call the static `configureUsing()` method from the `boot()` method of a service provider. The function will be run for each table that gets created:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Enums\FiltersLayout;
use Filament\Tables\Table;

Table::configureUsing(function (Table $table): void {
    $table
        ->filtersLayout(FiltersLayout::AboveContentCollapsible)
        ->paginationPageOptions([10, 25, 50]);
});
```

# Documentation for tables. File: 11-adding-a-table-to-a-livewire-component.md
---
title: Adding a table to a Livewire component
---

## Setting up the Livewire component

First, generate a new Livewire component:

```bash
php artisan make:livewire ListProducts
```

Then, render your Livewire component on the page:

```blade
@livewire('list-products')
```

Alternatively, you can use a full-page Livewire component:

```php
use App\Livewire\ListProducts;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

Route::get('products', ListProducts::class);
```

## Adding the table

There are 3 tasks when adding a table to a Livewire component class:

1) Implement the `HasTable` and `HasForms` interfaces, and use the `InteractsWithTable` and `InteractsWithForms` traits.
2) Add a `table()` method, which is where you configure the table. [Add the table's columns, filters, and actions](getting-started#columns).
3) Make sure to define the base query that will be used to fetch rows in the table. For example, if you're listing products from your `Product` model, you will want to return `Product::query()`.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Livewire;

use App\Models\Shop\Product;
use Filament\Forms\Concerns\InteractsWithForms;
use Filament\Forms\Contracts\HasForms;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;
use Filament\Tables\Concerns\InteractsWithTable;
use Filament\Tables\Contracts\HasTable;
use Filament\Tables\Table;
use Illuminate\Contracts\View\View;
use Livewire\Component;

class ListProducts extends Component implements HasForms, HasTable
{
    use InteractsWithTable;
    use InteractsWithForms;
    
    public function table(Table $table): Table
    {
        return $table
            ->query(Product::query())
            ->columns([
                TextColumn::make('name'),
            ])
            ->filters([
                // ...
            ])
            ->actions([
                // ...
            ])
            ->bulkActions([
                // ...
            ]);
    }
    
    public function render(): View
    {
        return view('livewire.list-products');
    }
}
```

Finally, in your Livewire component's view, render the table:

```blade
<div>
    {{ $this->table }}
</div>
```

Visit your Livewire component in the browser, and you should see the table.

## Building a table for an Eloquent relationship

If you want to build a table for an Eloquent relationship, you can use the `relationship()` and `inverseRelationship()` methods on the `$table` instead of passing a `query()`. `HasMany`, `HasManyThrough`, `BelongsToMany`, `MorphMany` and `MorphToMany` relationships are compatible:

```php
use App\Models\Category;
use Filament\Tables\Table;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\BelongsToMany;

public Category $category;

public function table(Table $table): Table
{
    return $table
        ->relationship(fn (): BelongsToMany => $this->category->products())
        ->inverseRelationship('categories')
        ->columns([
            TextColumn::make('name'),
        ]);
}
```

In this example, we have a `$category` property which holds a `Category` model instance. The category has a relationship named `products`. We use a function to return the relationship instance. This is a many-to-many relationship, so the inverse relationship is called `categories`, and is defined on the `Product` model. We just need to pass the name of this relationship to the `inverseRelationship()` method, not the whole instance.

Now that the table is using a relationship instead of a plain Eloquent query, all actions will be performed on the relationship instead of the query. For example, if you use a [`CreateAction`](../actions/prebuilt-actions/create), the new product will be automatically attached to the category.

If your relationship uses a pivot table, you can use all pivot columns as if they were normal columns on your table, as long as they are listed in the `withPivot()` method of the relationship *and* inverse relationship definition.

Relationship tables are used in the Panel Builder as ["relation managers"](../panels/resources/relation-managers#creating-a-relation-manager). Most of the documented features for relation managers are also available for relationship tables. For instance, [attaching and detaching](../panels/resources/relation-managers#attaching-and-detaching-records) and [associating and dissociating](../panels/resources/relation-managers#associating-and-dissociating-records) actions.

## Generating table Livewire components with the CLI

It's advised that you learn how to set up a Livewire component with the Table Builder manually, but once you are confident, you can use the CLI to generate a table for you.

```bash
php artisan make:livewire-table Products/ListProducts
```

This will ask you for the name of a prebuilt model, for example `Product`. Finally, it will generate a new `app/Livewire/Products/ListProducts.php` component, which you can customize.

### Automatically generating table columns

Filament is also able to guess which table columns you want in the table, based on the model's database columns. You can use the `--generate` flag when generating your table:

```bash
php artisan make:livewire-table Products/ListProducts --generate
```

# Documentation for tables. File: 12-testing.md

title: Testing

## Overview

All examples in this guide will be written using [Pest](https://pestphp.com). To use Pest's Livewire plugin for testing, you can follow the installation instructions in the Pest documentation on plugins: [Livewire plugin for Pest](https://pestphp.com/docs/plugins#livewire). However, you can easily adapt this to PHPUnit.

Since the Table Builder works on Livewire components, you can use the [Livewire testing helpers](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/testing). However, we have many custom testing helpers that you can use for tables:

## Render

To ensure a table component renders, use the `assertSuccessful()` Livewire helper:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can render page', function () {
    livewire(ListPosts::class)->assertSuccessful();
});
```

To test which records are shown, you can use `assertCanSeeTableRecords()`, `assertCanNotSeeTableRecords()` and `assertCountTableRecords()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('cannot display trashed posts by default', function () {
    $posts = Post::factory()->count(4)->create();
    $trashedPosts = Post::factory()->trashed()->count(6)->create();

    livewire(PostResource\Pages\ListPosts::class)
        ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($posts)
        ->assertCanNotSeeTableRecords($trashedPosts)
        ->assertCountTableRecords(4);
});
```

> If your table uses pagination, `assertCanSeeTableRecords()` will only check for records on the first page. To switch page, call `call('gotoPage', 2)`.

> If your table uses `deferLoading()`, you should call `loadTable()` before `assertCanSeeTableRecords()`.

## Columns

To ensure that a certain column is rendered, pass the column name to `assertCanRenderTableColumn()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can render post titles', function () {
    Post::factory()->count(10)->create();

    livewire(PostResource\Pages\ListPosts::class)
        ->assertCanRenderTableColumn('title');
});
```

This helper will get the HTML for this column, and check that it is present in the table.

For testing that a column is not rendered, you can use `assertCanNotRenderTableColumn()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can not render post comments', function () {
    Post::factory()->count(10)->create()

    livewire(PostResource\Pages\ListPosts::class)
        ->assertCanNotRenderTableColumn('comments');
});
```

This helper will assert that the HTML for this column is not shown by default in the present table.

### Sorting

To sort table records, you can call `sortTable()`, passing the name of the column to sort by. You can use `'desc'` in the second parameter of `sortTable()` to reverse the sorting direction.

Once the table is sorted, you can ensure that the table records are rendered in order using `assertCanSeeTableRecords()` with the `inOrder` parameter:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can sort posts by title', function () {
    $posts = Post::factory()->count(10)->create();

    livewire(PostResource\Pages\ListPosts::class)
        ->sortTable('title')
        ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($posts->sortBy('title'), inOrder: true)
        ->sortTable('title', 'desc')
        ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($posts->sortByDesc('title'), inOrder: true);
});
```

### Searching

To search the table, call the `searchTable()` method with your search query.

You can then use `assertCanSeeTableRecords()` to check your filtered table records, and use `assertCanNotSeeTableRecords()` to assert that some records are no longer in the table:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can search posts by title', function () {
    $posts = Post::factory()->count(10)->create();

    $title = $posts->first()->title;

    livewire(PostResource\Pages\ListPosts::class)
        ->searchTable($title)
        ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($posts->where('title', $title))
        ->assertCanNotSeeTableRecords($posts->where('title', '!=', $title));
});
```

To search individual columns, you can pass an array of searches to `searchTableColumns()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can search posts by title column', function () {
    $posts = Post::factory()->count(10)->create();

    $title = $posts->first()->title;

    livewire(PostResource\Pages\ListPosts::class)
        ->searchTableColumns(['title' => $title])
        ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($posts->where('title', $title))
        ->assertCanNotSeeTableRecords($posts->where('title', '!=', $title));
});
```

### State

To assert that a certain column has a state or does not have a state for a record you can use `assertTableColumnStateSet()` and `assertTableColumnStateNotSet()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can get post author names', function () {
    $posts = Post::factory()->count(10)->create();

    $post = $posts->first();

    livewire(PostResource\Pages\ListPosts::class)
        ->assertTableColumnStateSet('author.name', $post->author->name, record: $post)
        ->assertTableColumnStateNotSet('author.name', 'Anonymous', record: $post);
});
```

To assert that a certain column has a formatted state or does not have a formatted state for a record you can use `assertTableColumnFormattedStateSet()` and `assertTableColumnFormattedStateNotSet()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can get post author names', function () {
    $post = Post::factory(['name' => 'John Smith'])->create();

    livewire(PostResource\Pages\ListPosts::class)
        ->assertTableColumnFormattedStateSet('author.name', 'Smith, John', record: $post)
        ->assertTableColumnFormattedStateNotSet('author.name', $post->author->name, record: $post);
});
```

### Existence

To ensure that a column exists, you can use the `assertTableColumnExists()` method:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('has an author column', function () {
    livewire(PostResource\Pages\ListPosts::class)
        ->assertTableColumnExists('author');
});
```

You may pass a function as an additional argument in order to assert that a column passes a given "truth test". This is useful for asserting that a column has a specific configuration. You can also pass in a record as the third parameter, which is useful if your check is dependant on which table row is being rendered:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

it('has an author column', function () {
    $post = Post::factory()->create();
    
    livewire(PostResource\Pages\ListPosts::class)
        ->assertTableColumnExists('author', function (TextColumn $column): bool {
            return $column->getDescriptionBelow() === $post->subtitle;
        }, $post);
});
```

### Authorization

To ensure that a particular user cannot see a column, you can use the `assertTableColumnVisible()` and `assertTableColumnHidden()` methods:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('shows the correct columns', function () {
    livewire(PostResource\Pages\ListPosts::class)
        ->assertTableColumnVisible('created_at')
        ->assertTableColumnHidden('author');
});
```

### Descriptions

To ensure a column has the correct description above or below you can use the `assertTableColumnHasDescription()` and `assertTableColumnDoesNotHaveDescription()` methods:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('has the correct descriptions above and below author', function () {
    $post = Post::factory()->create();

    livewire(PostsTable::class)
        ->assertTableColumnHasDescription('author', 'Author! ↓↓↓', $post, 'above')
        ->assertTableColumnHasDescription('author', 'Author! ↑↑↑', $post)
        ->assertTableColumnDoesNotHaveDescription('author', 'Author! ↑↑↑', $post, 'above')
        ->assertTableColumnDoesNotHaveDescription('author', 'Author! ↓↓↓', $post);
});
```

### Extra Attributes

To ensure that a column has the correct extra attributes, you can use the `assertTableColumnHasExtraAttributes()` and `assertTableColumnDoesNotHaveExtraAttributes()` methods:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('displays author in red', function () {
    $post = Post::factory()->create();

    livewire(PostsTable::class)
        ->assertTableColumnHasExtraAttributes('author', ['class' => 'text-danger-500'], $post)
        ->assertTableColumnDoesNotHaveExtraAttributes('author', ['class' => 'text-primary-500'], $post);
});
```

### Select Columns

If you have a select column, you can ensure it has the correct options with `assertTableSelectColumnHasOptions()` and `assertTableSelectColumnDoesNotHaveOptions()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('has the correct statuses', function () {
    $post = Post::factory()->create();

    livewire(PostsTable::class)
        ->assertTableSelectColumnHasOptions('status', ['unpublished' => 'Unpublished', 'published' => 'Published'], $post)
        ->assertTableSelectColumnDoesNotHaveOptions('status', ['archived' => 'Archived'], $post);
});
```

## Filters

To filter the table records, you can use the `filterTable()` method, along with `assertCanSeeTableRecords()` and `assertCanNotSeeTableRecords()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can filter posts by `is_published`', function () {
    $posts = Post::factory()->count(10)->create();

    livewire(PostResource\Pages\ListPosts::class)
        ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($posts)
        ->filterTable('is_published')
        ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($posts->where('is_published', true))
        ->assertCanNotSeeTableRecords($posts->where('is_published', false));
});
```

For a simple filter, this will just enable the filter.

If you'd like to set the value of a `SelectFilter` or `TernaryFilter`, pass the value as a second argument:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can filter posts by `author_id`', function () {
    $posts = Post::factory()->count(10)->create();

    $authorId = $posts->first()->author_id;

    livewire(PostResource\Pages\ListPosts::class)
        ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($posts)
        ->filterTable('author_id', $authorId)
        ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($posts->where('author_id', $authorId))
        ->assertCanNotSeeTableRecords($posts->where('author_id', '!=', $authorId));
});
```

### Resetting filters

To reset all filters to their original state, call `resetTableFilters()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can reset table filters', function () {
    $posts = Post::factory()->count(10)->create();

    livewire(PostResource\Pages\ListPosts::class)
        ->resetTableFilters();
});
```

### Removing Filters

To remove a single filter you can use `removeTableFilter()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('filters list by published', function () {
    $posts = Post::factory()->count(10)->create();

    $unpublishedPosts = $posts->where('is_published', false)->get();

    livewire(PostsTable::class)
        ->filterTable('is_published')
        ->assertCanNotSeeTableRecords($unpublishedPosts)
        ->removeTableFilter('is_published')
        ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($posts);
});
```

To remove all filters you can use `removeTableFilters()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can remove all table filters', function () {
    $posts = Post::factory()->count(10)->forAuthor()->create();

    $unpublishedPosts = $posts
        ->where('is_published', false)
        ->where('author_id', $posts->first()->author->getKey());

    livewire(PostsTable::class)
        ->filterTable('is_published')
        ->filterTable('author', $author)
        ->assertCanNotSeeTableRecords($unpublishedPosts)
        ->removeTableFilters()
        ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($posts);
});
```

### Hidden filters

To ensure that a particular user cannot see a filter, you can use the `assertTableFilterVisible()` and `assertTableFilterHidden()` methods:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('shows the correct filters', function () {
    livewire(PostsTable::class)
        ->assertTableFilterVisible('created_at')
        ->assertTableFilterHidden('author');
```

### Filter existence

To ensure that a filter exists, you can use the `assertTableFilterExists()` method:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('has an author filter', function () {
    livewire(PostResource\Pages\ListPosts::class)
        ->assertTableFilterExists('author');
});
```

You may pass a function as an additional argument in order to assert that a filter passes a given "truth test". This is useful for asserting that a filter has a specific configuration:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;
use Filament\Tables\Filters\SelectFilter;

it('has an author filter', function () {    
    livewire(PostResource\Pages\ListPosts::class)
        ->assertTableFilterExists('author', function (SelectFilter $column): bool {
            return $column->getLabel() === 'Select author';
        });
});
```

## Actions

### Calling actions

You can call an action by passing its name or class to `callTableAction()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can delete posts', function () {
    $post = Post::factory()->create();

    livewire(PostResource\Pages\ListPosts::class)
        ->callTableAction(DeleteAction::class, $post);

    $this->assertModelMissing($post);
});
```

This example assumes that you have a `DeleteAction` on your table. If you have a custom `Action::make('reorder')`, you may use `callTableAction('reorder')`.

For column actions, you may do the same, using `callTableColumnAction()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can copy posts', function () {
    $post = Post::factory()->create();

    livewire(PostResource\Pages\ListPosts::class)
        ->callTableColumnAction('copy', $post);

    $this->assertDatabaseCount((new Post)->getTable(), 2);
});
```

For bulk actions, you may do the same, passing in multiple records to execute the bulk action against with `callTableBulkAction()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can bulk delete posts', function () {
    $posts = Post::factory()->count(10)->create();

    livewire(PostResource\Pages\ListPosts::class)
        ->callTableBulkAction(DeleteBulkAction::class, $posts);

    foreach ($posts as $post) {
        $this->assertModelMissing($post);
    }
});
```

To pass an array of data into an action, use the `data` parameter:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can edit posts', function () {
    $post = Post::factory()->create();

    livewire(PostResource\Pages\ListPosts::class)
        ->callTableAction(EditAction::class, $post, data: [
            'title' => $title = fake()->words(asText: true),
        ])
        ->assertHasNoTableActionErrors();

    expect($post->refresh())
        ->title->toBe($title);
});
```

### Execution

To check if an action or bulk action has been halted, you can use `assertTableActionHalted()` / `assertTableBulkActionHalted()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('will halt delete if post is flagged', function () {
    $posts= Post::factory()->count(2)->flagged()->create();

    livewire(PostResource\Pages\ListPosts::class)
        ->callTableAction('delete', $posts->first())
        ->callTableBulkAction('delete', $posts)
        ->assertTableActionHalted('delete')
        ->assertTableBulkActionHalted('delete');

    $this->assertModelExists($post);
});
```

### Errors

`assertHasNoTableActionErrors()` is used to assert that no validation errors occurred when submitting the action form.

To check if a validation error has occurred with the data, use `assertHasTableActionErrors()`, similar to `assertHasErrors()` in Livewire:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can validate edited post data', function () {
    $post = Post::factory()->create();

    livewire(PostResource\Pages\ListPosts::class)
        ->callTableAction(EditAction::class, $post, data: [
            'title' => null,
        ])
        ->assertHasTableActionErrors(['title' => ['required']]);
});
```

For bulk actions these methods are called `assertHasTableBulkActionErrors()` and `assertHasNoTableBulkActionErrors()`.

### Pre-filled data

To check if an action or bulk action is pre-filled with data, you can use the `assertTableActionDataSet()` or `assertTableBulkActionDataSet()` method:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can load existing post data for editing', function () {
    $post = Post::factory()->create();

    livewire(PostResource\Pages\ListPosts::class)
        ->mountTableAction(EditAction::class, $post)
        ->assertTableActionDataSet([
            'title' => $post->title,
        ])
        ->setTableActionData([
            'title' => $title = fake()->words(asText: true),
        ])
        ->callMountedTableAction()
        ->assertHasNoTableActionErrors();

    expect($post->refresh())
        ->title->toBe($title);
});
```

You may also find it useful to pass a function to the `assertTableActionDataSet()` and `assertTableBulkActionDataSet()` methods, which allow you to access the form `$state` and perform additional assertions:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Str;
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can automatically generate a slug from the title without any spaces', function () {
    $post = Post::factory()->create();

    livewire(PostResource\Pages\ListPosts::class)
        ->mountTableAction(EditAction::class, $post)
        ->assertTableActionDataSet(function (array $state) use ($post): array {
            expect($state['slug'])
                ->not->toContain(' ');
                
            return [
                'slug' => Str::slug($post->title),
            ];
        });
});
```

### Action state

To ensure that an action or bulk action exists or doesn't in a table, you can use the `assertTableActionExists()` / `assertTableActionDoesNotExist()` or  `assertTableBulkActionExists()` / `assertTableBulkActionDoesNotExist()` method:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can publish but not unpublish posts', function () {
    livewire(PostResource\Pages\ListPosts::class)
        ->assertTableActionExists('publish')
        ->assertTableActionDoesNotExist('unpublish')
        ->assertTableBulkActionExists('publish')
        ->assertTableBulkActionDoesNotExist('unpublish');
});
```

To ensure different sets of actions exist in the correct order, you can use the various "InOrder" assertions

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('has all actions in expected order', function () {
    livewire(PostResource\Pages\ListPosts::class)
        ->assertTableActionsExistInOrder(['edit', 'delete'])
        ->assertTableBulkActionsExistInOrder(['restore', 'forceDelete'])
        ->assertTableHeaderActionsExistInOrder(['create', 'attach'])
        ->assertTableEmptyStateActionsExistInOrder(['create', 'toggle-trashed-filter'])
});
```

To ensure that an action or bulk action is enabled or disabled for a user, you can use the `assertTableActionEnabled()` / `assertTableActionDisabled()` or `assertTableBulkActionEnabled()` / `assertTableBulkActionDisabled()` methods:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can not publish, but can delete posts', function () {
    $post = Post::factory()->create();

    livewire(PostResource\Pages\ListPosts::class)
        ->assertTableActionDisabled('publish', $post)
        ->assertTableActionEnabled('delete', $post)
        ->assertTableBulkActionDisabled('publish')
        ->assertTableBulkActionEnabled('delete');
});
```


To ensure that an action or bulk action is visible or hidden for a user, you can use the `assertTableActionVisible()` / `assertTableActionHidden()` or `assertTableBulkActionVisible()` / `assertTableBulkActionHidden()` methods:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can not publish, but can delete posts', function () {
    $post = Post::factory()->create();

    livewire(PostResource\Pages\ListPosts::class)
        ->assertTableActionHidden('publish', $post)
        ->assertTableActionVisible('delete', $post)
        ->assertTableBulkActionHidden('publish')
        ->assertTableBulkActionVisible('delete');
});
```

### Button Style

To ensure an action or bulk action has the correct label, you can use `assertTableActionHasLabel()` / `assertTableBulkActionHasLabel()` and `assertTableActionDoesNotHaveLabel()` / `assertTableBulkActionDoesNotHaveLabel()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('delete actions have correct labels', function () {
    $post = Post::factory()->create();

    livewire(PostResource\Pages\ListPosts::class)
        ->assertTableActionHasLabel('delete', 'Archive Post')
        ->assertTableActionDoesNotHaveLabel('delete', 'Delete');
        ->assertTableBulkActionHasLabel('delete', 'Archive Post')
        ->assertTableBulkActionDoesNotHaveLabel('delete', 'Delete');
});
```

To ensure an action or bulk action's button is showing the correct icon, you can use `assertTableActionHasIcon()` / `assertTableBulkActionHasIcon()` or `assertTableActionDoesNotHaveIcon()` / `assertTableBulkActionDoesNotHaveIcon()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('delete actions have correct icons', function () {
    $post = Post::factory()->create();

    livewire(PostResource\Pages\ListPosts::class)
        ->assertTableActionHasIcon('delete', 'heroicon-m-archive-box')
        ->assertTableActionDoesNotHaveIcon('delete', 'heroicon-m-trash');
        ->assertTableBulkActionHasIcon('delete', 'heroicon-m-archive-box')
        ->assertTableBulkActionDoesNotHaveIcon('delete', 'heroicon-m-trash');
});
```

To ensure that an action or bulk action's button is displaying the right color, you can use `assertTableActionHasColor()` / `assertTableBulkActionHasColor()` or `assertTableActionDoesNotHaveColor()` / `assertTableBulkActionDoesNotHaveColor()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('delete actions have correct colors', function () {
    $post = Post::factory()->create();

    livewire(PostResource\Pages\ListPosts::class)
        ->assertTableActionHasColor('delete', 'warning')
        ->assertTableActionDoesNotHaveColor('delete', 'danger');
        ->assertTableBulkActionHasColor('delete', 'warning')
        ->assertTableBulkActionDoesNotHaveColor('delete', 'danger');
});
```

### URL

To ensure an action or bulk action has the correct URL traits, you can use `assertTableActionHasUrl()`, `assertTableActionDoesNotHaveUrl()`, `assertTableActionShouldOpenUrlInNewTab()`, and `assertTableActionShouldNotOpenUrlInNewTab()`:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('links to the correct Filament sites', function () {
    $post = Post::factory()->create();

    livewire(PostResource\Pages\ListPosts::class)
        ->assertTableActionHasUrl('filament', 'https://filamentphp.com/')
        ->assertTableActionDoesNotHaveUrl('filament', 'https://github.com/filamentphp/filament')
        ->assertTableActionShouldOpenUrlInNewTab('filament')
        ->assertTableActionShouldNotOpenUrlInNewTab('github');
});
```

## Summaries

To test that a summary calculation is working, you may use the `assertTableColumnSummarySet()` method:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can average values in a column', function () {
    $posts = Post::factory()->count(10)->create();

    livewire(PostResource\Pages\ListPosts::class)
        ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($posts)
        ->assertTableColumnSummarySet('rating', 'average', $posts->avg('rating'));
});
```

The first argument is the column name, the second is the summarizer ID, and the third is the expected value.

Note that the expected and actual values are normalized, such that `123.12` is considered the same as `"123.12"`, and `['Fred', 'Jim']` is the same as `['Jim', 'Fred']`.

You may set a summarizer ID by passing it to the `make()` method:

```php
use Filament\Tables\Columns\Summarizers\Average;
use Filament\Tables\Columns\TextColumn;

TextColumn::make('rating')
    ->summarize(Average::make('average'))
```

The ID should be unique between summarizers in that column.

### Summarizing only one pagination page

To calculate the average for only one pagination page, use the `isCurrentPaginationPageOnly` argument:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can average values in a column', function () {
    $posts = Post::factory()->count(20)->create();

    livewire(PostResource\Pages\ListPosts::class)
        ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($posts->take(10))
        ->assertTableColumnSummarySet('rating', 'average', $posts->take(10)->avg('rating'), isCurrentPaginationPageOnly: true);
});
```

### Testing a range summarizer

To test a range, pass the minimum and maximum value into a tuple-style `[$minimum, $maximum]` array:

```php
use function Pest\Livewire\livewire;

it('can average values in a column', function () {
    $posts = Post::factory()->count(10)->create();

    livewire(PostResource\Pages\ListPosts::class)
        ->assertCanSeeTableRecords($posts)
        ->assertTableColumnSummarySet('rating', 'range', [$posts->min('rating'), $posts->max('rating')]);
});
```

title: Upgrading from v2.x

> If you see anything missing from this guide, please do not hesitate to [make a pull request](https://github.com/filamentphp/filament/edit/3.x/packages/tables/docs/13-upgrade-guide.md) to our repository! Any help is appreciated!

## New requirements

- Laravel v10.0+
- Livewire v3.0+

Please upgrade Filament before upgrading to Livewire v3. Instructions on how to upgrade Livewire can be found [here](https://livewire.laravel.com/docs/upgrading).

## Upgrading automatically

The easiest way to upgrade your app is to run the automated upgrade script. This script will automatically upgrade your application to the latest version of Filament, and make changes to your code which handle most breaking changes.

```bash
composer require filament/upgrade:"^3.2" -W --dev
vendor/bin/filament-v3
```

Make sure to carefully follow the instructions, and review the changes made by the script. You may need to make some manual changes to your code afterwards, but the script should handle most of the repetitive work for you.

Finally, you must run `php artisan filament:install` to finalize the Filament v3 installation. This command must be run for all new Filament projects.

You can now `composer remove filament/upgrade` as you don't need it anymore.

> Some plugins you're using may not be available in v3 just yet. You could temporarily remove them from your `composer.json` file until they've been upgraded, replace them with a similar plugins that are v3-compatible, wait for the plugins to be upgraded before upgrading your app, or even write PRs to help the authors upgrade them.

## Upgrading manually

After upgrading the dependency via Composer, you should execute `php artisan filament:upgrade` in order to clear any Laravel caches and publish the new frontend assets.

### High-impact changes

#### Config file renamed and combined with other Filament packages

Only one config file is now used for all Filament packages. Most configuration has been moved into other parts of the codebase, and little remains. You should use the v3 documentation as a reference when replace the configuration options you did modify. To publish the new configuration file and remove the old one, run:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=filament-config --force
rm config/tables.php
```

#### `TABLES_FILESYSTEM_DRIVER` .env variable

The `TABLES_FILESYSTEM_DRIVER` .env variable has been renamed to `FILAMENT_FILESYSTEM_DISK`. This is to make it more consistent with Laravel, as Laravel v9 introduced this change as well. Please ensure that you update your .env files accordingly, and don't forget production!

#### New `@filamentScripts` and `@filamentStyles` Blade directives

The `@filamentScripts` and `@filamentStyles` Blade directives must be added to your Blade layout file/s. Since Livewire v3 no longer uses similar directives, you can replace `@livewireScripts` with `@filamentScripts`  and `@livewireStyles` with `@filamentStyles`.

#### CSS file removed

The CSS file for form components, `module.esm.css`, has been removed. Check `resources/css/app.css`. That CSS is now automatically loaded by `@filamentStyles`.

#### JavaScript files removed

You no longer need to import the `FormsAlpinePlugin` in your JavaScript files. Alpine plugins are now automatically loaded by `@filamentScripts`.

#### Heroicons have been updated to v2

The Heroicons library has been updated to v2. This means that any icons you use in your app may have changed names. You can find a list of changes [here](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/heroicons/releases/tag/v2.0.0).

### Medium-impact changes

#### Secondary color

Filament v2 had a `secondary` color for many components which was gray. All references to `secondary` should be replaced with `gray` to preserve the same appearance. This frees `secondary` to be registered to a new custom color of your choice.

#### `BadgeColumn::enum()` removed

You can use a `formatStateUsing()` function to transform text.

#### Enum classes moved

The following enum classes have moved:

- `Filament\Tables\Actions\Position` has moved to `Filament\Tables\Enums\ActionsPosition`.
- `Filament\Tables\Actions\RecordCheckboxPosition` has moved to `Filament\Tables\Enums\RecordCheckboxPosition`.
- `Filament\Tables\Filters\Layout` has moved to `Filament\Tables\Enums\FiltersLayout`.

# Documentation for widgets. File: 01-installation.md
---
title: Installation
---

**The Widgets package is pre-installed with the [Panel Builder](/docs/panels).** This guide is for using the Widgets package in a custom TALL Stack application (Tailwind, Alpine, Livewire, Laravel).

## Requirements

Filament requires the following to run:

- PHP 8.1+
- Laravel v10.0+
- Livewire v3.0+
- Tailwind v3.0+ [(Using Tailwind v4?)](#installing-tailwind-css)

## Installation

Require the Widgets package using Composer:

```bash
composer require filament/widgets:"^3.3" -W
```

## New Laravel projects

To quickly get started with Filament in a new Laravel project, run the following commands to install [Livewire](https://livewire.laravel.com), [Alpine.js](https://alpinejs.dev), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com):

> Since these commands will overwrite existing files in your application, only run this in a new Laravel project!

```bash
php artisan filament:install --scaffold --widgets

npm install

npm run dev
```

## Existing Laravel projects

Run the following command to install the Widgets package assets:

```bash
php artisan filament:install --widgets
```

### Installing Tailwind CSS

> Filament uses Tailwind CSS v3 for styling. If your project uses Tailwind CSS v4, you will unfortunately need to downgrade it to v3 to use Filament. Filament v3 can't support Tailwind CSS v4 since it introduces breaking changes. Filament v4 will support Tailwind CSS v4.

Run the following command to install Tailwind CSS with the Tailwind Forms and Typography plugins:

```bash
npm install tailwindcss@3 @tailwindcss/forms @tailwindcss/typography postcss postcss-nesting autoprefixer --save-dev
```

Create a new `tailwind.config.js` file and add the Filament `preset` *(includes the Filament color scheme and the required Tailwind plugins)*:

```js
import preset from './vendor/filament/support/tailwind.config.preset'

export default {
    presets: [preset],
    content: [
        './app/Filament/**/*.php',
        './resources/views/filament/**/*.blade.php',
        './vendor/filament/**/*.blade.php',
    ],
}
```

### Configuring styles

Add Tailwind's CSS layers to your `resources/css/app.css`:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
@tailwind variants;
```

Create a `postcss.config.js` file in the root of your project and register Tailwind CSS, PostCSS Nesting and Autoprefixer as plugins:

```js
export default {
    plugins: {
        'tailwindcss/nesting': 'postcss-nesting',
        tailwindcss: {},
        autoprefixer: {},
    },
}
```

### Automatically refreshing the browser
You may also want to update your `vite.config.js` file to refresh the page automatically when Livewire components are updated:

```js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import laravel, { refreshPaths } from 'laravel-vite-plugin'

export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [
        laravel({
            input: ['resources/css/app.css', 'resources/js/app.js'],
            refresh: [
                ...refreshPaths,
                'app/Livewire/**',
            ],
        }),
    ],
})
```

### Compiling assets

Compile your new CSS and Javascript assets using `npm run dev`.

### Configuring your layout

Create a new `resources/views/components/layouts/app.blade.php` layout file for Livewire components:

```blade
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="{{ str_replace('_', '-', app()->getLocale()) }}">
    <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">

        <meta name="application-name" content="{{ config('app.name') }}">
        <meta name="csrf-token" content="{{ csrf_token() }}">
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

        <title>{{ config('app.name') }}</title>

        <style>
            [x-cloak] {
                display: none !important;
            }
        </style>

        @filamentStyles
        @vite('resources/css/app.css')
    </head>

    <body class="antialiased">
        {{ $slot }}

        @filamentScripts
        @vite('resources/js/app.js')
    </body>
</html>
```

## Publishing configuration

You can publish the package configuration using the following command (optional):

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=filament-config
```

## Upgrading

Filament automatically upgrades to the latest non-breaking version when you run `composer update`. After any updates, all Laravel caches need to be cleared, and frontend assets need to be republished. You can do this all at once using the `filament:upgrade` command, which should have been added to your `composer.json` file when you ran `filament:install` the first time:

```json
"post-autoload-dump": [
    // ...
    "@php artisan filament:upgrade"
],
```

Please note that `filament:upgrade` does not actually handle the update process, as Composer does that already. If you're upgrading manually without a `post-autoload-dump` hook, you can run the command yourself:

```bash
composer update

php artisan filament:upgrade
```

# Documentation for widgets. File: 02-stats-overview.md
---
title: Stats overview widgets
---

## Overview

Filament comes with a "stats overview" widget template, which you can use to display a number of different stats in a single widget, without needing to write a custom view.

Start by creating a widget with the command:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-widget StatsOverview --stats-overview
```

This command will create a new `StatsOverview.php` file. Open it, and return `Stat` instances from the `getStats()` method:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Filament\Widgets;

use Filament\Widgets\StatsOverviewWidget as BaseWidget;
use Filament\Widgets\StatsOverviewWidget\Stat;

class StatsOverview extends BaseWidget
{
    protected function getStats(): array
    {
        return [
            Stat::make('Unique views', '192.1k'),
            Stat::make('Bounce rate', '21%'),
            Stat::make('Average time on page', '3:12'),
        ];
    }
}
```

Now, check out your widget in the dashboard.

## Adding a description and icon to a stat

You may add a `description()` to provide additional information, along with a `descriptionIcon()`:

```php
use Filament\Widgets\StatsOverviewWidget\Stat;

protected function getStats(): array
{
    return [
        Stat::make('Unique views', '192.1k')
            ->description('32k increase')
            ->descriptionIcon('heroicon-m-arrow-trending-up'),
        Stat::make('Bounce rate', '21%')
            ->description('7% decrease')
            ->descriptionIcon('heroicon-m-arrow-trending-down'),
        Stat::make('Average time on page', '3:12')
            ->description('3% increase')
            ->descriptionIcon('heroicon-m-arrow-trending-up'),
    ];
}
```

The `descriptionIcon()` method also accepts a second parameter to put the icon before the description instead of after it:

```php
use Filament\Support\Enums\IconPosition;
use Filament\Widgets\StatsOverviewWidget\Stat;

Stat::make('Unique views', '192.1k')
    ->description('32k increase')
    ->descriptionIcon('heroicon-m-arrow-trending-up', IconPosition::Before)
```

## Changing the color of the stat

You may also give stats a `color()` (`danger`, `gray`, `info`, `primary`, `success` or `warning`):

```php
use Filament\Widgets\StatsOverviewWidget\Stat;

protected function getStats(): array
{
    return [
        Stat::make('Unique views', '192.1k')
            ->description('32k increase')
            ->descriptionIcon('heroicon-m-arrow-trending-up')
            ->color('success'),
        Stat::make('Bounce rate', '21%')
            ->description('7% increase')
            ->descriptionIcon('heroicon-m-arrow-trending-down')
            ->color('danger'),
        Stat::make('Average time on page', '3:12')
            ->description('3% increase')
            ->descriptionIcon('heroicon-m-arrow-trending-up')
            ->color('success'),
    ];
}
```

## Adding extra HTML attributes to a stat

You may also pass extra HTML attributes to stats using `extraAttributes()`:

```php
use Filament\Widgets\StatsOverviewWidget\Stat;

protected function getStats(): array
{
    return [
        Stat::make('Processed', '192.1k')
            ->color('success')
            ->extraAttributes([
                'class' => 'cursor-pointer',
                'wire:click' => "\$dispatch('setStatusFilter', { filter: 'processed' })",
            ]),
        // ...
    ];
}
```

In this example, we are deliberately escaping the `$` in `$dispatch()` since this needs to be passed directly to the HTML, it is not a PHP variable.

## Adding a chart to a stat

You may also add or chain a `chart()` to each stat to provide historical data. The `chart()` method accepts an array of data points to plot:

```php
use Filament\Widgets\StatsOverviewWidget\Stat;

protected function getStats(): array
{
    return [
        Stat::make('Unique views', '192.1k')
            ->description('32k increase')
            ->descriptionIcon('heroicon-m-arrow-trending-up')
            ->chart([7, 2, 10, 3, 15, 4, 17])
            ->color('success'),
        // ...
    ];
}
```

## Live updating stats (polling)

By default, stats overview widgets refresh their data every 5 seconds.

To customize this, you may override the `$pollingInterval` property on the class to a new interval:

```php
protected static ?string $pollingInterval = '10s';
```

Alternatively, you may disable polling altogether:

```php
protected static ?string $pollingInterval = null;
```

## Disabling lazy loading

By default, widgets are lazy-loaded. This means that they will only be loaded when they are visible on the page.

To disable this behavior, you may override the `$isLazy` property on the widget class:

```php
protected static bool $isLazy = false;
```

## Adding a heading and description

You may also add heading and description text above the widget by overriding the `$heading` and `$description` properties:

```php
protected ?string $heading = 'Analytics';

protected ?string $description = 'An overview of some analytics.';
```

If you need to dynamically generate the heading or description text, you can instead override the `getHeading()` and `getDescription()` methods:

```php
protected function getHeading(): ?string
{
    return 'Analytics';
}

protected function getDescription(): ?string
{
    return 'An overview of some analytics.';
}
```

# Documentation for widgets. File: 03-charts.md
---
title: Chart widgets
---

## Overview

Filament comes with many "chart" widget templates, which you can use to display real-time, interactive charts.

Start by creating a widget with the command:

```bash
php artisan make:filament-widget BlogPostsChart --chart
```

There is a single `ChartWidget` class that is used for all charts. The type of chart is set by the `getType()` method. In this example, that method returns the string `'line'`.

The `protected static ?string $heading` variable is used to set the heading that describes the chart. If you need to set the heading dynamically, you can override the `getHeading()` method.

The `getData()` method is used to return an array of datasets and labels. Each dataset is a labeled array of points to plot on the chart, and each label is a string. This structure is identical to the [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/docs) library, which Filament uses to render charts. You may use the [Chart.js documentation](https://www.chartjs.org/docs) to fully understand the possibilities to return from `getData()`, based on the chart type.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Filament\Widgets;

use Filament\Widgets\ChartWidget;

class BlogPostsChart extends ChartWidget
{
    protected static ?string $heading = 'Blog Posts';

    protected function getData(): array
    {
        return [
            'datasets' => [
                [
                    'label' => 'Blog posts created',
                    'data' => [0, 10, 5, 2, 21, 32, 45, 74, 65, 45, 77, 89],
                ],
            ],
            'labels' => ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun', 'Jul', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec'],
        ];
    }

    protected function getType(): string
    {
        return 'line';
    }
}
```

Now, check out your widget in the dashboard.

## Available chart types

Below is a list of available chart widget classes which you may extend, and their corresponding [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/docs) documentation page, for inspiration on what to return from `getData()`:

- Bar chart - [Chart.js documentation](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/charts/bar)
- Bubble chart - [Chart.js documentation](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/charts/bubble)
- Doughnut chart - [Chart.js documentation](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/charts/doughnut)
- Line chart - [Chart.js documentation](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/charts/line)
- Pie chart - [Chart.js documentation](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/charts/doughnut.html#pie)
- Polar area chart - [Chart.js documentation](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/charts/polar)
- Radar chart - [Chart.js documentation](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/charts/radar)
- Scatter chart - [Chart.js documentation](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/charts/scatter)

## Customizing the chart color

You can customize the color of the chart data by setting the `$color` property to either `danger`, `gray`, `info`, `primary`, `success` or `warning`:

```php
protected static string $color = 'info';
```

If you're looking to customize the color further, or use multiple colors across multiple datasets, you can still make use of Chart.js's [color options](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/general/colors.html) in the data:

```php
protected function getData(): array
{
    return [
        'datasets' => [
            [
                'label' => 'Blog posts created',
                'data' => [0, 10, 5, 2, 21, 32, 45, 74, 65, 45, 77, 89],
                'backgroundColor' => '#36A2EB',
                'borderColor' => '#9BD0F5',
            ],
        ],
        'labels' => ['Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun', 'Jul', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec'],
    ];
}
```

## Generating chart data from an Eloquent model

To generate chart data from an Eloquent model, Filament recommends that you install the `flowframe/laravel-trend` package. You can view the [documentation](https://github.com/Flowframe/laravel-trend).

Here is an example of generating chart data from a model using the `laravel-trend` package:

```php
use Flowframe\Trend\Trend;
use Flowframe\Trend\TrendValue;

protected function getData(): array
{
    $data = Trend::model(BlogPost::class)
        ->between(
            start: now()->startOfYear(),
            end: now()->endOfYear(),
        )
        ->perMonth()
        ->count();

    return [
        'datasets' => [
            [
                'label' => 'Blog posts',
                'data' => $data->map(fn (TrendValue $value) => $value->aggregate),
            ],
        ],
        'labels' => $data->map(fn (TrendValue $value) => $value->date),
    ];
}
```

## Filtering chart data

You can set up chart filters to change the data shown on chart. Commonly, this is used to change the time period that chart data is rendered for.

To set a default filter value, set the `$filter` property:

```php
public ?string $filter = 'today';
```

Then, define the `getFilters()` method to return an array of values and labels for your filter:

```php
protected function getFilters(): ?array
{
    return [
        'today' => 'Today',
        'week' => 'Last week',
        'month' => 'Last month',
        'year' => 'This year',
    ];
}
```

You can use the active filter value within your `getData()` method:

```php
protected function getData(): array
{
    $activeFilter = $this->filter;

    // ...
}
```

## Live updating chart data (polling)

By default, chart widgets refresh their data every 5 seconds.

To customize this, you may override the `$pollingInterval` property on the class to a new interval:

```php
protected static ?string $pollingInterval = '10s';
```

Alternatively, you may disable polling altogether:

```php
protected static ?string $pollingInterval = null;
```

## Setting a maximum chart height

You may place a maximum height on the chart to ensure that it doesn't get too big, using the `$maxHeight` property:

```php
protected static ?string $maxHeight = '300px';
```

## Setting chart configuration options

You may specify an `$options` variable on the chart class to control the many configuration options that the Chart.js library provides. For instance, you could turn off the [legend](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/configuration/legend.html) for a line chart:

```php
protected static ?array $options = [
    'plugins' => [
        'legend' => [
            'display' => false,
        ],
    ],
];
```

Alternatively, you can override the `getOptions()` method to return a dynamic array of options:

```php
protected function getOptions(): array
{
    return [
        'plugins' => [
            'legend' => [
                'display' => false,
            ],
        ],
    ];
}
```

These PHP arrays will get transformed into JSON objects when the chart is rendered. If you want to return raw JavaScript from this method instead, you can return a `RawJs` object. This is useful if you want to use a JavaScript callback function, for example:

```php
use Filament\Support\RawJs;

protected function getOptions(): RawJs
{
    return RawJs::make(<<<JS
        {
            scales: {
                y: {
                    ticks: {
                        callback: (value) => '€' + value,
                    },
                },
            },
        }
    JS);
}
```

## Adding a description

You may add a description, below the heading of the chart, using the `getDescription()` method:

```php
public function getDescription(): ?string
{
    return 'The number of blog posts published per month.';
}
```

## Disabling lazy loading

By default, widgets are lazy-loaded. This means that they will only be loaded when they are visible on the page.

To disable this behavior, you may override the `$isLazy` property on the widget class:

```php
protected static bool $isLazy = true;
```

## Using custom Chart.js plugins

Chart.js offers a powerful plugin system that allows you to extend its functionality and create custom chart behaviors. This guide details how to use them in a chart widget.

### Step 1: Install the plugin with NPM

To start with, install the plugin using NPM into your project. In this guide, we will install [`chartjs-plugin-datalabels`](https://chartjs-plugin-datalabels.netlify.app/guide/getting-started.html#installation):

```bash
npm install chartjs-plugin-datalabels --save-dev
```

### Step 2: Create a JavaScript file importing the plugin

Create a new JavaScript file where you will define your custom plugin. In this guide, we'll call it `filament-chart-js-plugins.js`. Import the plugin, and add it to the `window.filamentChartJsPlugins` array:

```javascript
import ChartDataLabels from 'chartjs-plugin-datalabels'

window.filamentChartJsPlugins ??= []
window.filamentChartJsPlugins.push(ChartDataLabels)
```

It's important to initialise the array if it has not been already, before pushing onto it. This ensures that mutliple JavaScript files (especially those from Filament plugins) that register Chart.js plugins do not overwrite each other, regardless of the order they are booted in.

You can push as many plugins to the `filamentChartJsPlugins` array as you would like to install, you do not need a separate file to import each plugin.

### Step 3: Compile the JavaScript file with Vite

Now, you need to build the JavaScript file with Vite, or your bundler of choice. Include the file in your Vite configuration (usually `vite.config.js`). For example:

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
import laravel from 'laravel-vite-plugin';

export default defineConfig({
    plugins: [
        laravel({
            input: [
                'resources/css/app.css',
                'resources/js/app.js',
                'resources/css/filament/admin/theme.css',
                'resources/js/filament-chart-js-plugins.js', // Include the new file in the `input` array so it is built
            ],
        }),
    ],
});
```

Build the file with `npm run build`.

### Step 4: Register the JavaScript file in Filament

Filament needs to know to include this JavaScript file when rendering chart widgets. You can do this in the `boot()` method of a service provider like `AppServiceProvider`:

```php
use Filament\Support\Assets\Js;
use Filament\Support\Facades\FilamentAsset;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Vite;

FilamentAsset::register([
    Js::make('chart-js-plugins', Vite::asset('resources/js/filament-chart-js-plugins.js'))->module(),
]);
```

You can find out more about [asset registration](../support/assets), and even [register assets for a specific panel](../panels/configuration#registering-assets-for-a-panel).

When using the [Panel Builder](../panels), you can use table widgets. These use the [table builder](../tables). You can find out how to create them [here](../panels/dashboard#table-widgets).

If you're not using the Panel Builder, there's no need to use a "widget" to render a table. You can simply [add a table to a Livewire component](../tables/adding-a-table-to-a-livewire-component), which does not provide any specific benefits over a widget.

## Overview

Since widgets are Livewire components, you can easily render a widget in any Blade view using the `@livewire` directive:

```blade
<div>
    @livewire(\App\Livewire\Dashboard\PostsChart::class)
</div>
```
